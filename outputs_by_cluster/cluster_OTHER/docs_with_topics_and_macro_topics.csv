"State, Education, and Violence: Reclaiming the Social Contract","{Education remains a significant space of contention in the Maoist conflict zone, in which the popular policy discourse on widening access to and ensuring equitable education encounters several challenges.

The spread of education remains far low in the region with inadequate school infrastructure, low quality of teachers, lack of education accountability structures, and even an overall low aspiration for education fuelled by the established low credentials of educational progress. The paper argues that insurgent groups find school buildings as the only government space in remote areas for their ‘soft targets.' The bombing of school buildings ended the prospects for education in the community and created constant fear among the people. Moreover, the occupation by the security forces of the school buildings has damaged normal educational processes. In both cases, education institutions remain a soft target, a space where the outcome of a constant crossfire between security and Maoists is aggravated into the normal educational processes.

We analyze self-rated health of 1,584 twin pairs aged 4–18. We did find strong support for the idea that parental resources influence children's health: household income and fathers' education consistently show positive effects.

We also did not find that the genetic influence on health increases during childhood and adolescence.

Uncovering latent profiles of ICT self-concept among adults in Germany and their relation with gender,"{Self-concept related to the use of information and communication technology (ICT-SC) is reflected in how people feel and behave when confronted with digital technologies. Although evidence from variable-centered analyses suggests a hierarchical and multidimensional structure of ICT-SC in heterogeneous populations, it is not yet known whether different profiles of general ICT-SC and specific ICT-SC domains (communicate, process and store, generate content, safe application, solve problems) exist. This study aims to extend previous research using person-centered analyses and to examine whether different profiles of ICT-SC can be identified in a heterogeneous adult population (18–69 years) from Germany and how these profiles relate to gender. Results of a latent profile analysis (German quota sample, N = 369) indicate a reliable three-profile solution. Profile I (n = 48) is characterised by rather low ICT-SC with relative profile strengths in the verbal-interactive domains (communicate, process and store).

Why we need to abandon fixed cutoffs for goodness-of-fit indices: An extensive simulation and possible solutions,"{To evaluate model fit in confirmatory factor analysis, researchers compare goodness-of-fit indices (GOFs) against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI >.950) derived from simulation studies. Methodologists have cautioned that cutoffs for GOFs are only valid for settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which cutoffs originated. Despite these warnings, fixed cutoffs for popular GOFs (i.e., χ2, χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) continue to be widely used in applied research. We (1) argue that the practice of using fixed cutoffs needs to be abandoned and (2) review time-honored and emerging alternatives to fixed cutoffs. We first present the most in-depth simulation study to date on the sensitivity of GOFs to model misspecification (i.e., misspecified factor dimensionality and unmodeled cross-loadings) and their susceptibility to further data and analysis characteristics (i.e., estimator, number of indicators, number and distribution of response options, loading magnitude, sample size, and factor correlation). We included all characteristics identified as influential in previous studies. Our simulation enabled us to replicate well-known influences on GOFs and establish hitherto unknown or underappreciated ones. In particular, the magnitude of the factor correlation turned out to moderate the effects of several characteristics on GOFs.

Furthermore, contributors have singularly decided at least one proposal in 20.41% of DAOs. Notably, contributors tend to be centrally positioned within the DAO governance ecosystem, suggesting the presence of inner power circles. Additionally, we observed a tendency for shifts in governance token ownership shortly before governance polls take place in 1202 (14.81%) of 8116 evaluated proposals.

The simulation-cum-ROC approach: A new approach to generate tailored cutoffs for fit indices through simulation and ROC analysis,"{To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥.950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest. Therefore, we propose a novel approach combining a Monte Carlo simulation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. This so-called simulation-cum-ROC approach generates tailored cutoffs and additionally identifies the most reliable fit indices in the setting of interest. We provide R code and a Shiny app for an easy implementation of the approach. No prior knowledge of Monte Carlo simulations or ROC analysis is needed to generate tailored cutoffs with the simulation-cum-ROC approach.}",2025,Behavior Research Methods,"{confirmatory factor analysis,cutoff,fit indices,roc,structural equation modeling}",Psychology (all),,,OTHER,2025,"the simulation-cum-roc approach: a new approach to generate tailored cutoffs for fit indices through simulation and roc analysis {to evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., cfi ≥.950). however, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. this is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. as a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. here, we review these approaches. we find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest. therefore, we propose a novel approach combining a monte carlo simulation with receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis. this so-called simulation-cum-roc approach generates tailored cutoffs and additionally identifies the most reliable fit indices in the setting of interest. we provide r code and a shiny app for an easy implementation of the approach. no prior knowledge of monte carlo simulations or roc analysis is needed to generate tailored cutoffs with the simulation-cum-roc approach.} {confirmatory factor analysis,cutoff,fit indices,roc,structural equation modeling} {confirmatory factor analysis,cutoff,fit indices,roc,structural equation modeling}",-1,0.0,"germany, ontology, marriage, networks, multilingual"
TJMN: Target-enhanced joint meta network with contrastive learning for cross-domain recommendation,"{Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) provides a promising solution to mitigate the sparsity issue in the target domain by exploiting auxiliary information from the source domain. Recently, meta learning based methods have been proposed and achieved the state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods learn the transfer bridge solely relying on the source domain while the rich information from the target domain are ignored. Moreover, they leverage either a common transfer bridge or a personalized transfer bridge to transform user representations, without considering the multi-grained characteristics of user preference. In this paper, we propose a target-enhanced joint meta network with contrastive learning (JTMN) for cross-domain recommendation. To be specific, we develop a target bridge to incorporate information from the target domain to guide the learning process of user preference transfer. In addition, we introduce multi-grained transfer bridges to model the complex transfer patterns of user preference across different domains. At last, a target-aware contrastive learning layer is designed to obtain better user representations.

Understanding the Impact of Entity Linking on the Topology of Entity Co-occurrence Networks for Social Media Analysis,"{A common form of analysis of textual data is entity co-occurrence, where networks of entities and their connections within the text are constructed and their topology analysed. As the analysis is focused on the entities and their relations, the tools used to extract them can have a potentially large effect on the results. A frequently used method as part of these analyses is entity linking, where extracted entities are mapped to a knowledge graph. Many established entity linking tools have been created for long text following standard spelling and grammar rules. As a result, the tools struggle on short, unstructured text such as tweets. On such text, it can be difficult to choose between tools and parameter settings, especially since ground truth is often unavailable. Given these challenges in entity linking on text and the direct influence of extracted entities on subsequent network analysis, we propose the need to apply multiple tools to create a more holistic set of results. We verify this assertion through a set of experiments. Using a dataset of approximately 21 million English-language tweets, we construct multiple entity co-occurrence networks using two tools (Fast Entity Linker and DBpedia Spotlight) and numerous confidence thresholds for each.
