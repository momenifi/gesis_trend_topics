Comparison of Four Active SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance Strategies in Representative Population Sample Points: Two-Factor Factorial Randomized Controlled Trial,"{Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by rapid increases in infection burden owing to the emergence of new variants with higher transmissibility and immune escape. To date, monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic has mainly relied on passive surveillance, yielding biased epidemiological measures owing to the disproportionate number of undetected asymptomatic cases. Active surveillance could provide accurate estimates of the true prevalence to forecast the evolution of the pandemic, enabling evidence-based decision-making. Objective: This study compared 4 different approaches of active SARS-CoV-2 surveillance focusing on feasibility and epidemiological outcomes. Methods: A 2-factor factorial randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2020 in a German district with 700,000 inhabitants. The epidemiological outcome comprised SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and its precision. The 4 study arms combined 2 factors: individuals versus households and direct testing versus testing conditioned on symptom prescreening. Individuals aged ≥7 years were eligible. Altogether, 27,908 addresses from 51 municipalities were randomly allocated to the arms and 15 consecutive recruitment weekdays. Data collection and logistics were highly digitized, and a website in 5 languages enabled low-barrier registration and tracking of results. Gargle sample collection kits were sent by post. Participants collected a gargle sample at home and mailed it to the laboratory. Samples were analyzed with reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP); positive and weak results were confirmed with real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Recruitment was conducted between November 18 and December 11, 2020. The response rates in the 4 arms varied between 34.31% (2340/6821) and 41.17% (2043/4962). The prescreening classified 16.61% (1207/7266) of the patients as COVID-19 symptomatic. Altogether, 4232 persons without prescreening and 7623 participating in the prescreening provided 5351 gargle samples, of which 5319 (99.4%) could be analyzed. This yielded 17 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and a combined prevalence of 0.36% (95% CI 0.14%-0.59%) in the arms without prescreening and 0.05% (95% CI 0.00%-0.108%) in the arms with prescreening (initial contacts only). Specifically, we found a prevalence of 0.31% (95% CI 0.06%-0.58%) for individuals and 0.35% (95% CI 0.09%-0.61%) for households, and lower estimates with prescreening (0.07%, 95% CI 0.0%-0.15% for individuals and 0.02%, 95% CI 0.0%-0.06% for households). Asymptomatic infections occurred in 27% (3/11) of the positive cases with symptom data. The 2 arms without prescreening performed the best regarding effectiveness and accuracy. Conclusions: This study showed that postal mailing of gargle sample kits and returning home-based self-collected liquid gargle samples followed by high-sensitivity RT-LAMP analysis is a feasible way to conduct active SARS-CoV-2 population surveillance without burdening routine diagnostic testing. Efforts to improve participation rates and integration into the public health system may increase the potential to monitor the course of the pandemic.}",2023,JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,"{cluster sampling,covid-19,effectiveness,multiarm,pandemic,randomized controlled trial,sars-cov-2,surveillance}",Medicine,BIO,1,"neck, baymedr, cup, prescreening, equivalence non inferiority",1.0
Long-term analysis of prognostic risk factors impacting surgical outcomes in patients with external auditory canal carcinoma,"{Background: Malignant neoplasms of the external auditory canal (EAC) are rare. No consensus on management has emerged. Objective: To determine possible risk factors influencing tumorgenesis and prognosis of EAC carcinoma. Materials and methods: 108 patients (87 men/21 women) with an average age of 74 ± 13.8 years were recruited from 2005 to 2019 at Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery Heidelberg. The follow-up interval was 43.62 ± 55.39 months. Partial and (sub)total ablative otis, supplementary surgery (petrosectomy, parotidectomy, neck dissection, mastoidectomy) and adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy belonged to treatment options. TNM status was determined at time of diagnosis using the AJCC staging system. Results: 63.9% of patients underwent a total ablative otis. Tumor recurrence was seen in 24.1%. The 1-year survival rate was 87%, the 5-year survival rate was 52%, the mean overall survival (OS) was 3.82 ± 4.6 years. Male EAC carcinoma patients had a better OS (p < 0.001), PFS (p < 0.001) and DSS (p = 0.02) than females. T1 patients had a better OS (p = 0.01), PFS (p = 0.01) and DSS (p < 0.001) than T4 patients. Lymph node but not distant metastasis, tumor grading, perineural, venous and lymphatic invasion, histology, age and tumor localization influenced the OS in EAC carcinoma patients (p = 0.04). The more radical the ablative otis, the worse the OS (p = 0.002), PFS (p = 0.02) and DSS (p < 0.001). Radio(chemo)therapy did not improve the OS. Conclusions: EAC carcinoma are difficult to treat and benefit from early diagnosis so that a radical combined treatment approach does not need to be used.}",2023,European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology,"{ablative otis,carcinoma of external auditory canal (eac),overall survival (os),prognostic risk factors}",Medicine,BIO,1,"neck, baymedr, cup, prescreening, equivalence non inferiority",1.0
A Short Scale to Measure Self-Reported Aversive Personality in Political Elites,"{In order to explain the behavior of political elites, research increasingly considers personality traits. Within this line of research, a recent focus is on socially aversive–yet non-pathological–personality traits (e.g., Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy), with the idea to better understand behavior violating generally accepted ethical, moral, and social norms. Assessments of politicians’ aversive personality traits have so far been almost exclusively based on observer reports of experts and voters. Herein, by contrast, we introduce the Political Elites Aversive Personality Scale (“PEAPS”) particularly tailored to measure self-reported aversive personality among politicians. More precisely, based on two studies with German politicians, we develop a 6-item short scale comprising aspects of different socially aversive personality traits (Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and spitefulness). The scale shows an acceptable model fit, an acceptable internal consistency, an acceptable measurement equivalence, and meaningful correlations with other (self-reported) psychological traits and campaign behavior. Moreover, the scale significantly contributes to the explanation of candidates’ negative campaigning, going beyond the explanatory power of models capturing broad, basic personality traits. Overall, the suggested scale provides interesting links to research in (political) psychology and can help to explain attitudes, behavior, and performance of political elites.}",2023,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.8254580249117163
"baymedr: an R package and web application for the calculation of Bayes factors for superiority, equivalence, and non-inferiority designs","{Background: Clinical trials often seek to determine the superiority, equivalence, or non-inferiority of an experimental condition (e.g., a new drug) compared to a control condition (e.g., a placebo or an already existing drug).

Can patient-reported outcomes and inflammatory markers define endotype 2 in chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps?,"{Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease at the clinical phenotype level (without nasal polyp [CRSsNP] vs with nasal polyp [CRSwNP]) and at the underlying inflammatory endotype level (type 2 vs non-type 2). Whether the endotype is associated with clinical presentation in patients with CRSsNP has yet to be explored in detail. Objective: To identify associations between endotypes and their clinical significance in patients with CRSsNP based on tissue interleukin-5 levels. Methods: A total of 104 patients with CRSsNP who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery between 2013 and 2017 were endotyped. We collected immunologic and clinical parameters and evaluated whether there were associations between the endotype and clinical features using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Sino-Nasal Outcome Test—22 (SNOT-22), Sniffin’ Sticks test, Lund-Mackay CT score, and nasal endoscopy. Results: Mean tissue interleukin-5 levels were used to identify type 2 inflammation (non-type 2: 3.37 vs type 2: 191.98 pg/g tissue; P < .001). There were no significant clinical differences measured by patient-reported outcome measures between patients with type 2 CRSsNP and those with non-type 2 CRSsNP preoperatively. Type 2 and non-type 2 CRSsNP did not differentiate in CT score, Sniffin’ Sticks test, and nasal endoscopy. Postoperative SNOT-22 and VAS scores correlated well with each other (r = 0.75; P < .01). Postoperative VAS scores were in both groups significantly lower than before the operation (type 2: 5.07 vs 2.99; P < .01; non-type 2: 5.74 vs 3.22; P < .01), but not associated to the inflammatory subtype.

Does a tonsillectomy indicated according to the German S2k guideline affect short-term quality of life in adults?,"{Background: Tonsillectomy (TE) for recurrent tonsillitis (RT) is one of the most common surgical interventions. Since 2015, the indication criteria for TE have become much stricter (German S2k guideline). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of short-term quality of life (QoL) after TE have not yet been investigated. Purpose: To clarify if stringent indication for TE will better identify patients worthy of surgery and patients’ QoL. Methods: We prospectively studied the Tonsillectomy Outcome Inventory 14 (TOI-14) responses of 38 RT-patients recruited according to the S2k guideline in 2020 and compared their TOI-14 scores with those of a historical RT cohort from 2006 to 2008 and with a healthy middle-European cohort. New RT patients were assessed before, 2, 4, and 14 days and 6 months after TE. TOI-14 was measured as total and as disease-specific score. Results: From pre- to 6-month postoperative, patients’ QoL was significantly different, measured by TOI-14 (49.92 vs. 6.35; p < 0.001) and disease-specific score (60.35 vs. 9.9; p < 0.001). Preoperative disease-specific score was not different from that of the 2nd and 4th postoperative days but from the 14th postoperative day (60.35 vs. 29.26; p < 0.001). The historical cohort had significantly less RT complaints than the new cohort beforehand, but more dissatisfaction in QoL after TE. New TE patients had worse QoL pre- (49.92 vs. 11.78; p < 0.001) but more QoL postoperatively (6.34 vs. 11.78; p = 0.004) than healthy individuals. Conclusions: Our results show that the tightening of the indication criteria for TE was justified and that TE patients significantly benefit from this surgery from day 14.}",2023,European Archives of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology,"{german s2k guideline,quality of life (qol),recurrent tonsillitis (rt),tonsillectomy,tonsillectomy outcome inventory 14 (toi-14)}",Medicine,BIO,1,"neck, baymedr, cup, prescreening, equivalence non inferiority",1.0

TSNN: A Topic and Structure Aware Neural Network for Rumor Detection,"{Detecting rumors on social media and preventing its spread play a critical role for politics, economy, etc. Conventional studies mainly focus on exploiting the content or context of the source post, while they always ignore the rich topic information within the source post. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a Topic and Structure Aware Neural Network (TSNN) for rumor detection. To be specific, we explore two kinds of topic signals, including a coarse-grained topic signal (i.e., topic credibility) and a fine-grained topic signal (i.e., latent topic representation), and tailor them to the task of rumor detection. Moreover, we introduce a new auxiliary task, i.e., topic credibility prediction, in order to effectively leverage the rich topic information within source posts. Finally, we develop a multi-task learning strategy that helps improve rumor detection performance by jointly learning the task of topic credibility prediction and user credibility prediction. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach TSNN is superior to the state-of-the-art baseline methods.}",2023,Neurocomputing,"{multi-task learning,neural topic models,rumor detection,topic credibility}",Neuroscience,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",1.0
"Human papillomavirus prevalence and vaccine effectiveness in young women in Germany, 2017/2018: results from a nationwide study","{Background: Infections with human papillomaviruses (HPV) are sexually transmitted and can cause cancer. In Germany, vaccination against HPV is recommended for girls and boys aged 9–17 years. We aimed to investigate HPV DNA prevalence, genotype distribution and vaccine effectiveness (VE) in women aged 20–25 years 10 years after the introduction of HPV vaccination in Germany (2018–2019), and compared these data to an equally designed study from 2010–2012. Methods: Seventy six geographical clusters were randomly selected, followed by random selection of 61 women aged 20–25 years per cluster. Participants performed cervicovaginal self-sampling and answered questions on demographics, sexual behaviour and HPV vaccination. Samples were tested for 18 high risk and nine low risk HPV genotypes. We performed chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact test, unpaired Student’s t-test and proportion t-test, and calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% CIs. Results: Of 7,858 contacted women a total of 1,226 agreed to participate. Of these, 94 women were positive for HPV types 16 and/or 18. HPV16 prevalence was 7.0% (95% CI 5.6–8.6) and HPV18 prevalence was 0.8% (95% CI 0.4–1.5). HPV6 and HPV11 were rare with only five (0.4%; 0.1–0.9) and one (0%; 95% CI 0.0–0.5) positive tests. Seven hundred fifty-seven women (62%) had received at least one HPV vaccine dose and 348 (28%) were vaccinated as currently recommended. Confounder-adjusted VE was 46.4% (95% CI 4.2–70.1) against HPV16/18 infection and 49.1% (95% CI 8.2–71.8) against infection with at least one HPV genotype covered by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Compared with the 2010–2012 study results, HPV16/18 prevalence dropped from 22.5% (95% CI 19.0–26.3) to 10.3% (95% CI 7.5–13.9; p < 0.0001) in unvaccinated participants. Conclusion: Vaccine-covered HPV genotypes were rare among 20–25 years old women in Germany and decreased compared to the time point shortly after the start of the HPV vaccination program. HPV prevalence of almost all vaccine-covered genotypes was strongly reduced in vaccinated participants. A decrease of HPV16 and HPV18 was even observed in unvaccinated participants, compared to 2010–2012 data, suggesting indirect protection of unvaccinated women. Low VE against HPV16/18 and HPV6/11/16/18 in our study might be attributable to study design in combination with the endpoint selection of (mainly transient) HPV DNA positivity.}",2023,Frontiers in Public Health,"{cervical cancer prevention,hpv genotyping,population-based study,prevalence,self-sampling,vaccine effectiveness}",Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.4884057010134769

In light of these gaps, this paper aims to offer a well-structured and comprehensive overview of the existing research conducted on anomaly detection over Knowledge Graphs. In this overview, we review the quality metrics of KGs and discuss the possible errors which may occur in different parts of the RDF data. Additionally, we outline a generic conceptual framework for the execution pipeline of Anomaly Detection over KGs. Moreover, we study the anomaly detection techniques, along with their variants, and present key assumptions, to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. Finally, we outline open issues in research and challenges encountered while adopting anomaly detection techniques for KGs.}",2023,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE 6th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering, AIKE 2023","{anomaly detection,knowledge graphs,linked open data,outlier detection,rdf data,semantic web}",Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.8011723906224547

Our preliminary study (N = 61) suggests that the belief in an indeterminate world is positively associated with uncertainty tolerance, whereas beliefs in free will and metaphysical dualism are not. We extend these findings by examining proxies of indeterminism belief in a cross-national dataset (N = 31 countries). We find that greater political and personal freedom is associated with higher tolerance for uncertainty, whereas religious belief, which posits a world determined by divine powers, is negatively associated with uncertainty tolerance. With these theoretical ideas and empirical findings, we hope to stimulate research to further advance our understanding of the association between belief in indeterminism and tolerating uncertainty.}",2023,Discover Psychology,"{autonomy,causality,indeterminism,tolerance,uncertainty}",Neuroscience,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.7788174623497541
Normative data for interpreting the SNOT-22,"{Objectives. The Sino-Nasal Outcome Test 22 (SNOT-22) is a validated patient-reported outcome instrument to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). There are no published normative SNOT-22 scores, limiting its interpretation. Methods. Symptom scores from 1,000 SNOT-22 questionnaires were analysed by princi-pal component analysis (PCA) and exploratory factor analyses. Data were derived from a survey with 1,000 healthy Europeans (reference cohort) who were recruited using the Re-spondi panel for market and social science research. This subsample was quoted to the pop-ulation distribution of the German Microcensus and selected from a non-probability panel. Results. The overall normative SNOT-22 score can be detected to be 20.2 ± 19.44. Male (18.49 ± 19.15) and older (> 50 years old; 18.3 ± 17.49) participants had overall lower SNOT-22 mean results than females (21.8 ± 19.6) and younger (21.4 ± 20.55) participants, indicating higher levels of satisfaction. PCA proposed two SNOT-22 domains (“physiologi-cal well-being” and “psychological well-being”), which explained 65% of the variance. Conclusions. These are the first published (German) normative scores for the SNOT-22 and provide a clinical reference point for the interpretation of data.}",2023,Acta Otorhinolaryngologica Italica,"{chronic rhinosinusitis,functional endoscopic sinus surgery,normative score,patient-reported outcome measures,sino-nasal outcome test 22}",Medicine,BIO,1,"neck, baymedr, cup, prescreening, equivalence non inferiority",0.7082799989626809
Measuring Six Facets of Curiosity in Germany and the UK: A German-Language Adaptation of the 5DCR and Its Comparability with the English-Language Source Version,"{The five-dimensional curiosity-scale revised (5DCR) by Kashdan et al. (2020) is the most comprehensive curiosity inventory available to date. 5DCR measures six facets of curiosity with four items each. Here, we present a German-language adaptation of the 5DCR and comprehensively validate this adaptation in a diverse sample of adults from Germany (N = 486). Moreover, we provide new evidence on the original English-language 5DCR in a parallel sample from the UK (N = 483). In both countries, we investigate the six facets' reliability, factorial validity, and convergent and discriminant validity with a large set of individual-differences constructs. In addition, we analyze the measurement invariance of the curiosity facets across the UK and Germany and across socio-demographic subgroups defined by age, sex, and education. Findings demonstrate that the new German-language adaptation of 5DCR and its English-language source version show psychometric properties similar to the original studies by Kashdan et al. (2020) in the United States. All six curiosity facets reach at least partial scalar invariance across cultures, sex, education, and mostly also across age groups. The findings support the six-faceted theory of curiosity and show that 5DCR allows for a valid assessment of curiosity across cultures.}",2023,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.5514619425208611

Big Five Domains and Facets Contextualized to the Work Domain Outperform Noncontextualized Ones,"{It is well-established that personality predicts a broad range of outcomes across life domains. However, the criterion validity of personality assessments is often limited. One strategy to increase criterion validity is to move from global, noncontextualized personality assessments toward contextualized personality assessments with reference to a specific context. We investigated whether a Big Five assessment contextualized to the work domain allows for better predictions of work-related outcomes than a noncontextualized Big Five assessment. Two hundred ninety respondents completed both the standard Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) and a work-specific variant thereof. In addition, they provided information on a broad range of work-related outcomes (job satisfaction, turnover intentions, organizational citizenship behavior, burnout risk, and occupational commitment), as well as on global health, a not strictly work-related outcome. Results showed that the contextualized personality assessment generally outperformed the noncontextualized one in terms of criterion validity for all outcomes, with the exception of global health. This applied to both the five broad personality domains and the 15 narrow personality facets. We conclude that if maximizing criterion validity in the work domain is the goal, contextualized personality assessments are preferable to noncontextualized ones.}",2024,Journal of Individual Differences,"{big five domains and facets,contextualized personality assessment,criterion validity,work domain}",Neuroscience,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.7215821031083888
The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale: Cross-National Measurement Invariance and Convergent Validity Evidence,"{Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS)is a widely used measure that captures somatic symptoms of coronavirus- related anxiety. In a large-scale collaboration spanning 60 countries (Ntotal = 21,513), we examined the CAS’s measurement invariance and assessed the convergent validity of CAS scores in relation to the fear of COVID-19(FCV-19S) and the satisfaction with life (SWLS-3) scales. We utilized both conventional exact invariance tests and alignmentprocedures,with results revealing that the single-factor model fit the data well in almost all countries. Partial scalar invariance was supported in a subset of 56 countries. To ensure the robustness of results, given the unbalanced samples, we employed resampling techniques both with and without replacement and found the results were more stable in larger samples. The alignment procedure demonstrated a high degree of measurement invariance with 9% of the parameters exhibiting non-invariance. Wealso conducted simulations of alignment using the parameters estimated in the current model. Findings demonstrated reliability of the means but indicated challenges in estimating the latent variances. Strong positive correlations between CAS and FCV-19S estimated with all three different approaches were found in most countries. Correlations of CAS and SWLS-3were weakandnegativebutsignificantly differed from zero in several countries. Overall, the study provided support for the measurement invariance of the CAS and offered evidence of its convergent validity while also highlighting issues with variance estimation.}",2024,Psychological Assessment,"{alignment,coronavirus anxiety,culture,measurement invariance,validity}",Medicine,BIO,1,"neck, baymedr, cup, prescreening, equivalence non inferiority",0.859325791205288
Regional differences and trends in healthy life expectancy in Germany,"{Background: Against the background of increasing life expectancy, the question arises in which state of health the additional years of life are spent. The aim of this study is to assess for the first time regional differences in healthy life expectancy for Germany. Methods: The concept of healthy life expectancy allows for the combination of regional differences in health status and mortality in a single measure. This article uses the concept of partial healthy life expectancy. We use official data on deaths and population numbers to calculate abridged life tables. Data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) are used to determine the age- and sex-specific prevalences of health status. Regional differences are analyzed from 2002 to 2019 by dividing Germany into four regions (North, South, East, West). Results: The regional differences in healthy life expectancy in Germany are greater than differences in life expectancy, and trends in healthy life expectancy partly differ from the corresponding trends in mortality. These differences over time also vary according to age: while healthy life expectancy has tended to stagnate and, in some cases, decline among the population aged between 20 and 64, the number and proportion of years in good health has increased among older adults up to the age of 79. Conclusion: There are striking regional differences and trends in the distribution of expected years in good health in Germany. The timely identification of regionally divergent developments could facilitate the implementation of targeted health-promoting measures.}",2024,Bundesgesundheitsblatt - Gesundheitsforschung - Gesundheitsschutz,"{compression,health-related quality of life,partial healthy life expectancy,partial life expectancy,regional differences}",Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.46096663251950726
Measuring Global Character Dimensions: An Ant Colony Optimization Approach toward Three Core Strength Scales,"{The Values in Action (VIA) framework encompasses 24 universally valued character strengths. Recent factor-analytic work has identified three global core strengths (metatraits) that proved to be well-interpretable and cross-culturally replicable: positivity, dependability, and mastery. However, there are no short scales to economically measure these core strengths that would encourage (large-scale) survey-based research on the global level of the VIA trait space. In the present study, we selected 18 items to measure the three metatraits from the 96-item IPIP-VIA-R inventory. To optimize the item selection while considering multiple psychometric criteria simultaneously, we made use of Ant Colony Optimization. Thereby, we obtained balanced-keyed scales that cover the heterogeneous constructs well, showed good model fit and reliability across six samples from Germany and the U.K. (total N = 2,754), and achieved scalar measurement invariance across countries. Furthermore, we demonstrated each scale’s validity by locating the three core strengths in a nomological net with personality and value metatraits, life satisfaction, and behavioral criteria. Available in the public domain in English and German, these both valid and economical core strength scales may further stimulate integrative research on personality and values.}",2024,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.7884046504624871

Short-term quality of life assessment after sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis,"{Background Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) has a negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is the treatment of choice for those not responding to medical treatments. To date, the short-term effects of FESS on HRQoL are still unclear. Objective Evaluation of the short-term effects of FESS on HRQoL in CRS patients using the SNOT-22 questionnaire. Methods The results of the validated German version of the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) questionnaire were analysed from 89 patients with CRS before surgery and 10-14 days (n = 77), four (n = 77), six weeks (n = 76) and 6 months (n = 71) after FESS, and compared with those of 1,000 healthy controls selected using a non-probability quota sample in accordance to the distribution of the German Microcensus. Results Compared to the preoperative mean SNOT-22 score (47.35), CRS patients significantly improved in HRQoL 10-14 days (31.75, p < 0.01), 4 weeks (25.84, p < 0.01), 6 weeks (24.16, p < 0.01) and 6 months after FESS (27.16, p < 0.01). Pre- and 6 months postoperatively, the five most important SNOT-22 items were nasal obstruction, smell and taste reduction, thick, mucous nasal secretions, need to blow the nose and postnasal drip. At the 2, 4 and 6-week follow-up, the reduction in smell and taste was most frequently perceived as limiting the HRQoL. Conclusions This follow-up study shows for the first time that the reduction in smell and taste should be treated and controlled concervatively in the short term after FESS.}",2024,Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie,"{chronic rhinosinusitis,fess,quality of life,short-term follow-up,snot-22}",Medicine,BIO,-1,"sport, snot, chronic rhinosinusitis, type crssnp, tissue",0.6667870740355216
Measuring the Four Higher-Order Values in Schwartz’s Theory: Validation of a 17-Item Inventory,"{Schwartz’s theory of basic human values is the dominant framework for assessing values. One of its strengths is that it allows for different levels of analysis. The 10 basic values can be reliably assigned to four higher-order dimensions: Openness to Change, Conservation, Self-Transcendence, and Self-Enhancement. In this paper, we examined the psychometric properties of the Higher-Order-Value Scale-17 (HOVS17), an inventory that economically assesses these higher-order values. We analyzed data from the GESIS Panel, an ongoing large-scale probability-based panel study that fields HOVS17 annually since 2013 and for which HOVS17 was originally developed. We found HOVS17 to have satisfactory psychometric properties. The 17 items were located in the two-dimensional multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) space as hypothesized. All four subscales were unidimensional, showed good fit when modeled as reflective latent variables, and had acceptable reliabilities as well as one-year test–retest stabilities (.65 to.69). The subscales correlated in theoretically plausible ways with a wide range of correlates and criteria, such as personality traits and well-being. This demonstrates that HOVS17 provides a sound basis for studying the development, precursors, and consequences of the higher-order values in the GESIS Panel and in future surveys that adopt HOVS17. We also discuss suggestions for further improvements of the inventory.}",2024,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",1.0
Measuring Intellectual Curiosity across Cultures: Validity and Comparability of a New Scale in Six Languages,"{Intellectual curiosity—the tendency to seek out and engage in opportunities for effortful cognitive activity—is a crucial construct in educational research and beyond. Measures of intellectual curiosity vary widely in psychometric quality, and few measures have demonstrated validity and comparability of scores across multiple languages. We analyzed a novel, six-item intellectual curiosity scale (ICS) originally developed for cross-national comparisons in the context of the OECD’s Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Samples from six countries representing six national languages (U.S. Germany, France, Spain, Poland, and Japan; total N = 5,557) confirmed that the ICS possesses very good psychometric properties. The scale is essentially unidimensional and showed excellent reliability estimates. On top of factorial validity, the scale demonstrated strict measurement invariance across demographic segments (gender, age groups, and educational strata) and at least partial scalar invariance across countries. As per its convergent and divergent associations with a broad range of constructs (e.g., Open-Mindedness and other Big Five traits, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Job Orientations, and Vocational Interests), it also showed convincing construct validity. Given its internal and external relationships, we recommend the ICS for assessing intellectual curiosity, especially in cross-cultural research applications, yet we also point out future research areas.}",2024,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.793274805360246

Linguistic feature fusion for Arabic fake news detection and named entity recognition using reinforcement learning and swarm optimization,"{In the context of the escalating use of social media in Arabic-speaking countries, driven by improved internet access, affordable smartphones, and a growing digital connectivity trend, this study addresses a significant challenge: the widespread dissemination of fake news. The ease and rapidity of spreading information on social media, coupled with a lack of stringent fact-checking measures, exacerbate the issue of misinformation. Our study examines how language features, especially Named Entity Recognition (NER) features, play a role in detecting fake news. We built two models: an AraBERT Multi-task Learning (MTL) based one for classifying Arabic fake news, and a token classification model that focuses on fake news NER features. The study combines embedding vectors from these models using an embedding fusion technique and applies machine learning algorithms for fake news detection in Arabic. We also introduced a feature selection algorithm named RLTTAO based on improving the Triangulation Topology Aggregation Optimizer (TTAO) performance using Reinforcement Learning and random opposition-based learning to enhance the performance by selecting relevant features, thereby improving the fusion process.

"Pancultural Nostalgia in Action: Prevalence, Triggers, and Psychological Functions of Nostalgia Across Cultures","{Nostalgia is a social, self-relevant, and bittersweet (although mostly positive) emotion that arises when reflecting on fond past memories and serves key psychological functions. The majority of evidence concerning the prevalence, triggers, and functions of nostalgia has been amassed in samples from a handful of largely Western cultures. If nostalgia is a fundamental psychological resource, it should perform similar functions across cultures, although its operational dynamics may be shaped by culture. This study (N = 2,606) examined dispositional nostalgia, self-reported triggers of nostalgia, and functions of experimentally induced nostalgia in young adults across 28 countries and a special administrative region of China (i.e., Hong Kong). Results indicated that nostalgia is frequently experienced across cultures, albeit better valued in more-developed countries (i.e., higher national wealth and life-expectancy). Nostalgia is triggered by psychological threats (especially in warmer countries), sensory stimuli (especially in more-developed countries), and social gatherings (especially in less-developed countries). The positive or negative affect prompted by experimentally induced nostalgia varied by country, but was mild overall. More importantly, recalling a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) memory increased social connectedness, self-continuity, and meaning in life across cultures. In less-developed countries, recalling an ordinary memory also conferred some of these functions, reducing the effect size of nostalgia. Finally, recalling a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) memory augmented state satisfaction with life in countries with lower quality of living (i.e., lower life-expectancy and life-satisfaction). Overall, findings confirm the relevance of nostalgia across a wide range of cultures and indicate cultural nuances in its functioning.}",2024,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,"{culture,emotion,memory,nostalgia,well-being}",Neuroscience,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",1.0

Aspects of Utilization of Psychotherapy in Germany in Times of the GDR and Later,"{Objective The aim of the study was to examine real differences in the use of psychotherapy in the New Federal States during the GDR era and today. In addition, differences according to the willingness seeking psychotherapy as well as barriers in opinions and contact to the mentally ill between people from the New Federal States, the Old Federal States and people who moved from the New Federal States to the Old Federal States (internal migrants) should be recorded, taking into account generational effects (experience of the Cold War - birth before / after January 1 st, 1980). Methods To investigate these questions, the data from a representative survey in the New Federal States of N=2729 people as well as the data from a second online based survey of people from the New and Old Federal States as well as internal migrants with a total of N=4789 participants were evaluated. Results There was a prevalence of 1% for the use of psychotherapy during the GDR era. Overall, the prevalence of therapy experiences among people who experienced the GDR and were born before January 1 st in 1980 was almost 13%. They also reported greater willingness seeking help for mental suffering since the end of the Cold War. The prevalence among younger people was about 12%. In the second survey, there were significant differences, among the older respondents. East Germans today and even during the GDR era were less willing to seek psychotherapy for mental suffering, they also have less contact to mentally ill people. Differences according to desires for distance from mentally ill people, self stigmatization in the presence of a mental illness and discrimination against mentally ill people emerged between East Germans, West Germans and internal migrants depending on generational affiliation. Discussion Barriers that prevent the use of psychotherapy should be taken into account on a generational and socialization specific basis.

Strength of statistical evidence for the efficacy of cancer drugs: a Bayesian reanalysis of randomized trials supporting Food and Drug Administration approval,"{Objectives: To quantify the strength of statistical evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for novel cancer drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the last 2 decades. Study Design and Setting: We used data on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and tumor response for novel cancer drugs approved for the first time by the Food and Drug Administration between January 2000 and December 2020. We assessed strength of statistical evidence by calculating Bayes factors (BFs) for all available endpoints, and we pooled evidence using Bayesian fixed-effect meta-analysis for indications approved based on 2 RCTs. Strength of statistical evidence was compared among endpoints, approval pathways, lines of treatment, and types of cancer. Results: We analysed the available data from 82 RCTs corresponding to 68 indications supported by a single RCT and 7 indications supported by 2 RCTs. Median strength of statistical evidence was ambiguous for OS (BF = 1.9; interquartile range [IQR] 0.5–14.5), and strong for progression-free survival (BF = 24,767.8; IQR 109.0–7.3 × 106) and tumor response (BF = 113.9; IQR 3.0–547,100). Overall, 44 indications (58.7%) were approved without clear statistical evidence for OS improvements and 7 indications (9.3%) were approved without statistical evidence for improvements on any endpoint. Strength of statistical evidence was lower for accelerated approval compared to nonaccelerated approval across all 3 endpoints. No meaningful differences were observed for line of treatment and cancer type. This analysis is limited to statistical evidence. We did not consider nonstatistical factors (eg, risk of bias, quality of the evidence). Conclusion: BFs offer novel insights into the strength of statistical evidence underlying cancer drug approvals. Most novel cancer drugs lack strong statistical evidence that they improve OS, and a few lack statistical evidence for efficacy altogether. These cases require a transparent and clear explanation. When evidence is ambiguous, additional postmarketing trials could reduce uncertainty.}",2024,Journal of Clinical Epidemiology,"{bayes factor,cancer drugs,evidence,overall survival,regulatory approval,surrogate endpoints}",Medicine,BIO,1,"neck, baymedr, cup, prescreening, equivalence non inferiority",1.0
Short-and long-term health effects of job insecurity. Fixed effects panel analysis of German data,"{Objective Previous research has linked job insecurity to health deterioration. The risk accumulation model suggests that health effects of job insecurity may persist even after job security is restored, yet long-term empirical analyses are scarce. Our study evaluates the long-term effects of accumulated exposures to affective job insecurity on mental and physical health among the working-age population in Germany. Method Using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (12 624 individuals; 84 219 observations), we applied panel regression models with individual fixed effects to assess short-and long-term health changes associated with affective job insecurity. Job insecurity was measured by respondents’ worries about job security. Mental and physical health was recorded with the SF-12 scale. Results Job insecurity correlated with short-term worsening in mental and physical health. However, after job insecurity ceased, health recovery was incomplete resulting in a long-term health deterioration. The long-term effects were larger among respondents who accumulated more instances of job insecurity, and showed a similar pattern for mental and physical health. An additional analysis documented stronger health effects of job insecurity among lower educated persons. Conclusion Our study is one of the first to empirically demonstrate the negative long-term health effects of job insecurity. Our findings for a well-protected labor market like Germany’s, suggest that the health risks associated with job insecurity may be substantial and potentially underestimated by studies that focus solely on short-term effects.}",2025,"Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment and Health","{affective job insecurity,cumulative advantage,health trajectory,incremental effect,precarious employment,precarious work,precarity,repeated exposure,risk accumulation,scarring effect,sf-12,soep}",Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.4457383160002196
Early Expressive and Receptive Language Development in Preterm vs Full-Term Children: A Meta-Analysis,"{CONTEXT: Although studies suggest that preterm children are more likely to develop speech or language disorders later in life, language differences between preterm and full-term children in early childhood are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the early development of receptive and expressive language in preterm children compared with full-term children by conducting a meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCO were searched in January 2024. STUDY SELECTION: Studies reporting receptive and/or expressive language using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, version 3 or 4, or vocabulary comprehension and/or production using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory. Studies comparing preterm and full-term children in the first 18 months of corrected age. DATA EXTRACTION: Study outcomes were transformed into Hedges g and synthesized using robust variance estimation. Risk of bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger’s regression test. RESULTS: Of 9464 records, a total of 34 studies using 21 individual datasets were eligible (N = 1825). Results indicate that preterm children score lower in receptive (g = −0.40; 95% CI, −0.60 to −0.19) and expressive (g = −0.44; 95% CI, −0.63 to −0.25) language. For receptive language, the difference increases with age and was higher for preterm children with lower gestational age and birth weight.

Patient-Specific Factors to Differentiate Between Branchial Cleft Cysts and CUP Syndrome: A 10 Year Unicenter Study,"{Objectives: Due to its generally-poor prognosis and varied clinical presentation, cervical cancer of unknown primary (CUP) poses particular challenges for clinical and imaging diagnosis. Differential diagnoses of CUP syndrome may also include lateral cervical cysts. When a benign neck cyst is initially suspected, squamous cell carcinoma is often diagnosed after receiving histopathology. Our study investigates the risk factors to differentiate between CUP syndrome and lateral neck cysts (LNC) to possibly improve the prognosis. Methods: Between 2013 and 2023, 244 patients with an initial diagnosis of LNC (n = 121) or CUP (n = 123) were recruited from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Heidelberg University Hospital and underwent panendoscopy with lymph node removal. In general, disease- and progression-free survival, prognostic relevant risk factors, and treatment data were recorded and analyzed. Results: The mean age of patients with CUP was significantly higher at 65 ± 13.2 years than that of patients with LNC (41 ± 15.8 years; P =.000). The calculated cutoff value was 50 to 59 years for a 50% chance of CUP syndrome or other malignant neck mass. Alcohol and tobacco consumption were not found to be risk factors. Previous tumor diseases were diagnosed more frequently in patients with CUP than in patients with LNC (P =.045). The 5 year overall survival for patients with CUP was 77.0% and did not differ significantly between the other various tumor entities (P =.423). Conclusions: The consideration of patient-specific factors such as age or synchronous/asynchronous malignancies is crucial in the diagnostic decision-making process. In the age group of 50 to 59 years, there is ~50% probability of diagnosing CUP syndrome with unilateral painless neck swelling. A thorough clinical examination using panendoscopy with at least 1 unilateral tonsillectomy and biopsies from the base of the tongue is essential to detect a possible primarius early and improve the prognosis.}",2025,"Ear, Nose and Throat Journal","{branchial cleft cysts,cup diagnostics and therapy,cup syndrome,head and neck cancer,risk factors}",Medicine,BIO,1,"neck, baymedr, cup, prescreening, equivalence non inferiority",1.0
Scoring German Alternate Uses Items Applying Large Language Models,"{The alternate uses task (AUT) is the most popular measure when it comes to the assessment of creative potential. Since their implementation, AUT responses have been rated by humans, which is a laborious task and requires considerable resources. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in automatically scoring AUT responses in English as well as in other languages, but it is not clear which method works best for German data. Therefore, we investigated the performance of different LLMs for the automated scoring of German AUT responses. We compiled German data across five research groups including ~50,000 responses for 15 different alternate uses objects from eight lab and online survey studies (including ~2300 participants) to examine generalizability across datasets and assessment conditions. Following a pre-registered analysis plan, we compared the performance of two fine-tuned, multilingual LLM-based approaches [Cross-Lingual Alternate Uses Scoring (CLAUS) and the Open Creativity Scoring with Artificial Intelligence (OCSAI)] with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4) in scoring (a) the original German AUT responses and (b) the responses translated to English. We found that the LLM-based scorings were substantially correlated with human ratings, with higher relationships for OCSAI followed by GPT-4 and CLAUS. Response translation, however, had no consistent positive effect. We discuss the generalizability of the results across different items and studies and derive recommendations and future directions.}",2025,Journal of Intelligence,"{alternate uses task,assessment,automated scoring,creativity,divergent thinking,german,gpt,large language models}",Neuroscience,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.5558426935706696
"The baseline examinations of the German National Cohort (NAKO): recruitment protocol, response, and weighting","{The German National Cohort (NAKO) is the largest population-based epidemiologic cohort study in Germany and investigates the causes of the most common chronic diseases. Between 2014 and 2019, a total of 1.3 million residents aged 20–69 years from 16 German regions were randomly selected from the general population and invited to participate following a highly standardized recruitment protocol. The overall response was 15.6% and differed considerably across study centers (7.6–30.7%). Females were more likely to participate than males (17.5% vs. 14.1%) and participation increased with age (10.2% in age group “ < 29 years” up to 20.7% in age group “ > 60 years”). Across all study regions, response was highest in rural areas (22.3%), followed by towns and suburbs (17.2%), and was lowest in cities (14.5%). Compared with the general population in the respective study regions, participants with low and medium education are underrepresented in the NAKO sample, while highly educated participants are overrepresented. Participants with non-German nationality and with a migration background are also underrepresented. Participants living in single households are underrepresented, while participants from larger households (2 or more persons) are overrepresented compared to the general population.

How to identify cystic lateral neck mass from CUP-like lesions: a diagnostic challenge,"{Objective A cystic lateral neck mass in adults represents a major challenge, as it can be difficult to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. The incidence of carcinoma in initially benign treated neck cysts is estimated to be as high as 24 %. The objective of this study was to ascertain the malignancy rate of cystic cervical masses and to provide a differentiation of cervical metastases in comparison to benign cervical cysts, utilising current guidelines. Material and Methods Between 2013 and 2023, a total of 155 patients with a suspected diagnosis of lateral neck cyst were recruited at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at our University Hospital. All patients underwent cyst removal, either alone or in conjunction with panendoscopy. Results A histologically confirmed ipsilateral lymph node metastasis was identified in 21.9 % of patients. The mean age of patients with malignant neck masses was significantly higher than that of patients with benign neck masses (64.0 ± 12.8 versus 41.0 ± 15.8; p < 0.001). The probability of malignancy was low in patients younger than 54 years (11 %), but increased markedly to 80 % in the age group of 60-69 years. The clinical sensitivity for initial suspicion of a benign neck cyst was 60.3%, while the specificity was 48.7%. Conclusions An individualized approach is necessary for the early diagnosis and treatment of unilateral neck cysts, as this condition requires a multifaceted assessment based on the patient’s medical history, clinical findings, imaging, and clinical expertise. We advise that patients over the age of 40 years undergo image morphological staging, a “no-touch” panendoscopy, and histological confirmation.}",2025,Laryngo- Rhino- Otologie,"{branchial cleft cysts,cup syndrome,head and neck cancer,neck cysts,risk factors}",Medicine,BIO,1,"neck, baymedr, cup, prescreening, equivalence non inferiority",1.0

"Risk factors and trajectories for self-harm, neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health conditions in pupils in alternative education provision in Wales: Population-based electronic cohort study","{Background Pupils in alternative education provision, known as 'Educated in Other Than At School' (EOTAS) in Wales, UK, are among the most vulnerable learners and who, for reasons such as mental health or behavioural challenges, do not attend a mainstream or special school. Aims We compared self-harm, neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health conditions between EOTAS pupils and controls with similar characteristics, before and after being in EOTAS provision. Method This population-based electronic cohort study included pupils in Wales aged 7-18 years, from the academic years 2010-11 to 2018-19. We linked data from Education Wales to primary and secondary healthcare records within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) Databank. Individuals included in the EOTAS data-set were identified as cases. Controls were pseudo-randomly selected based on equivalent age and academic year distribution. Results This study included 8056 pupils in EOTAS and 224 247 controls. Higher levels of deprivation, childhood maltreatment, self-harm, neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health conditions before EOTAS entry were linked to higher odds of being in EOTAS. Pupils in EOTAS provision had increased incidence of self-harm, neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health conditions, from 1 year after entering EOTAS provision up to 24 years of age, than pupils with similar characteristics not in EOTAS provision. Conclusion While EOTAS provision plays an important role, our findings indicate that it is not sufficient on its own to meet pupils' social, emotional, behavioural and mental health needs.

Legacy of the GDR: regional disparities in childhood maltreatment in post-unification Germany,"{Background: Previous research has identified growing up in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) as a protective factor against childhood abuse and neglect compared to growing up in the former Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). This study investigates whether these differences persist among individuals born after German reunification, providing a novel focus on the post-unification generation and the possible transgenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment in Germany. Method: The prevalence of self-reported abusive and neglected childhood experiences among 17- to 31-year-olds, stratified by gender and socio-political context (East/West), was examined using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Data of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KIGGS-study) between 2014 and 2017 was used. Logistic regression models were used to assess the influence of covariates such as age, subjective social status, and education on childhood trauma experiences. Results: Altogether, 18.6% (East = 15.8%/ West = 19.0%) of the N = 5,982 participants reported at least one type of maltreatment. The prevalence of at least moderate abuse was found to be 6.8% (East = 5.8%/West = 7.0%) for emotional, 3.7% (East = 2.4%/West = 3.9%) for physical, and 3.3% (East = 1.9%/West = 3.6%) for sexual abuse, and a prevalence of 9.2% (East = 8.5%/West = 9.3%) for emotional and 8.7% (East = 7.4%/West = 8.9%) for physical neglect. Individuals residing in eastern German regions reported significant lower prevalence rates for sexual and physical abuse, as well as overall maltreatment. Conclusion: Significant regional disparities in childhood maltreatment were observed among individuals raised in post-unification Germany, suggesting the persistence of sociopolitical influences from the former GDR as a protective factor. These findings underscore the importance of understanding transgenerational transmission factors of childhood maltreatment, such as parenting behaviors within differing sociopolitical contexts.

Out-of-Vocabulary Pashto Spell Checker using Morphological Operations,"{A spell checking model detects spelling errors in the input text, generates possible corrections for each error, and organizes them based on their relevance. Such tools are essential for writing, editing, and publishing in a language. In literature, different variants of edit distance and language models are used for dealing with spelling errors. The existing approaches have improved for efficient use of computational and memory resources without compromising accuracy. Exploiting the efforts made for other low-resource languages, we have proposed the first spell checking model for Pashto language. A common issue with the existing spell checker models of low-resourced languages is having many false positives due to limited vocabulary. Our proposed approach makes use of morphological operations to generate out-of-vocabulary words and is coupled with a filtering mechanism to retain the words with more repeating syllable patterns only. The n-gram probabilities are combined through linear interpolation to detect and correct spelling errors. The test samples with spelling errors are generated by randomizing characters for non-word errors and words in higher-order n-gram for real word errors. The proposed approach achieves detection accuracy of 85.5% and correction accuracy of 75.0%, respectively.}",2025,"2025 International Conference on Communication Technologies, ComTech 2025","{edit distance,language models,linear interpolation,spell checker}",Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.6063564061679395

Incentives and Trust Are the Main Drivers of Recruiting Participants in 6 African Countries via Web-Based Environments: A Vignette Survey Experiment,"{Background: In-person health surveys and biomarker collections (eg, blood testing) provide crucial data to monitor and investigate progress on health outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. Bearing in mind that administrative sampling frames are often outdated and financial resources can be limited, it is of substantial policy importance to better understand whether recruitment of individuals for in-person health data collection efforts can be accomplished via web-based environments such as social media sites. Yet, there is little methodological research on (1) the feasibility of recruitment through web-based environments and (2) the factors that drive in-person survey participation rates in sub-Saharan Africa countries. Objective: This study aimed to share our experimental results on the recruitment of individuals from sub-Saharan Africa for participation in in-person, health-related surveys and biomarker collections via Facebook ads and to provide recommendations for future data collections and research. Methods: We conducted a preregistered 2×4×4 vignette experiment to investigate people’s willingness to participate in in-person health surveys and blood tests. The experiment was part of a web survey (n≈10,600) of individuals recruited via Facebook advertisements that we conducted in early 2023 in 6 sub-Saharan Africa countries (Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda). Based on the theories of contextual integrity, economic participation, and social exchange, three factors were varied: (1) the topic (HIV or diabetes), (2) the incentive (US $0, US $2 cash, US $2 voucher, and US $2 lottery), and (3) the sponsor (nongovernmental organization, statistical office, health ministry, or local university). Results: Overall, we found that a majority of survey participants are willing to participate in in-person health surveys and provide biomarkers (vignette means range between 5.54 and 6.09 on a 1 to 7 scale). First, providing a financial incentive significantly increased the likelihood of being willing to participate (b=.180, .188, and .200; all P<.001). Second, individuals with high levels of trust in nongovernmental organizations or the health ministry were more likely to be willing to participate (b=.086 and .048; both P<.001). In contrast, 2 factors (topic and sponsor) showed mainly non-significant effects (b=.010, P=.63; b=.041, P=.18; b=.042, P=.19; b=.063, P=.05). Other factors that were related to an increase in willingness to participate included fertility levels (having children), risk-taking, having an illness (HIV, diabetes), better general health, social trust, trust in science, survey enjoyment, survey value, and cognitive skills. Conclusions: Together, the study’s results suggest that using a web-based environment for recruiting health research participants in sub-Saharan Africa can be a viable option and emphasize the importance of adequate compensation and trust in the sponsor. The findings also indicated that several attitudinal but almost none of the sociodemographic variables are systematically related to the willingness to participate in health-related in-person data collection activities.}",2025,Journal of Medical Internet Research,"{biomarker,incentives,monitoring health outcomes,participation,study sponsor,sub-saharan africa,survey methodology,topic,vignette experiment,web-based recruitment}",Medicine,BIO,-1,"sport, snot, chronic rhinosinusitis, type crssnp, tissue",0.48780346700757654

The long arm of repression: determinants of psychotherapy use among East Germans and its relevance for today’s institutional trust—psychotherapeutic implications of political repression in the former German Democratic Republic,"{Introduction: Maintaining trust in social institutions is a critical challenge for Western democracies. We examine the role of psychotherapy on institutional trust in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR; now: New Federal States of Germany) which used open and covert methods to keep opposition members under control. Methods: The study with n = 1,805 individuals who were born and socialized in the former GDR (i.e., born before 1980) was conducted in 2022. Logistic regression models to predict a person’s probability of psychotherapy use after the system change from the GDR to the New Federal States of Germany were built using a basic model derived from the literature with predictor variables such as gender and education. This model was extended by experiences of repression. In a second analysis, linear regression models to predict institutional trust were analyzed following a similar strategy with the addition of psychotherapy experience as a predictor. Results: Reporting repression in the GDR (44% of the total sample) was related to a higher probability of psychotherapy use. In the group who reported personally experienced repression (15% of the total sample), psychotherapy appeared to be relevant for higher levels of institutional trust. Discussion: Psychotherapy might have the potential to help regaining institutional trust after a system change. Psychotherapists should consider that patients who experienced (post-)socialism were commonly affected by repression and might show less institutional trust including the healthcare system. Furthermore, this study revealed an estimation of the occurrence of repression in a representative sample in the former GDR.}",2025,Frontiers in Public Health,"{gdr,institutional trust,psychotherapy,repression,system change}",Medicine,BIO,0,"german, uncertainty, childhood, psychotherapy, life expectancy",0.4278909225348497
