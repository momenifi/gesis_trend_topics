Comparison of Four Active SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance Strategies in Representative Population Sample Points: Two-Factor Factorial Randomized Controlled Trial,"{""Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is characterized by rapid increases in infection burden owing to the emergence of new variants with higher transmissibility and immune escape. To date, monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic has mainly relied on passive surveillance, yielding biased epidemiological measures owing to the disproportionate number of undetected asymptomatic cases. Active surveillance could provide accurate estimates of the true prevalence to forecast the evolution of the pandemic, enabling evidence-based decision-making. Objective: This study compared 4 different approaches of active SARS-CoV-2 surveillance focusing on feasibility and epidemiological outcomes. Methods: A 2-factor factorial randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2020 in a German district with 700,000 inhabitants. The epidemiological outcome comprised SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and its precision. The 4 study arms combined 2 factors: individuals versus households and direct testing versus testing conditioned on symptom prescreening. Individuals aged ≥7 years were eligible. Altogether, 27,908 addresses from 51 municipalities were randomly allocated to the arms and 15 consecutive recruitment weekdays. Data collection and logistics were highly digitized, and a website in 5 languages enabled low-barrier registration and tracking of results. Gargle sample collection kits were sent by post. Participants collected a gargle sample at home and mailed it to the laboratory. Samples were analyzed with reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP); positive and weak results were confirmed with real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Recruitment was conducted between November 18 and December 11, 2020. The response rates in the 4 arms varied between 34.31% (2340/6821) and 41.17% (2043/4962). The prescreening classified 16.61% (1207/7266) of the patients as COVID-19 symptomatic. Altogether, 4232 persons without prescreening and 7623 participating in the prescreening provided 5351 gargle samples, of which 5319 (99.4%) could be analyzed. This yielded 17 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections and a combined prevalence of 0.36% (95% CI 0.14%-0.59%) in the arms without prescreening and 0.05% (95% CI 0.00%-0.108%) in the arms with prescreening (initial contacts only). Specifically, we found a prevalence of 0.31% (95% CI 0.06%-0.58%) for individuals and 0.35% (95% CI 0.09%-0.61%) for households, and lower estimates with prescreening (0.07%, 95% CI 0.0%-0.15% for individuals and 0.02%, 95% CI 0.0%-0.06% for households). Asymptomatic infections occurred in 27% (3/11) of the positive cases with symptom data. The 2 arms without prescreening performed the best regarding effectiveness and accuracy. Conclusions: This study showed that postal mailing of gargle sample kits and returning home-based self-collected liquid gargle samples followed by high-sensitivity RT-LAMP analysis is a feasible way to conduct active SARS-CoV-2 population surveillance without burdening routine diagnostic testing.

Does a tonsillectomy indicated according to the German S2k guideline affect short-term quality of life in adults?,"{""Background: Tonsillectomy (TE) for recurrent tonsillitis (RT) is one of the most common surgical interventions. Since 2015, the indication criteria for TE have become much stricter (German S2k guideline). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of short-term quality of life (QoL) after TE have not yet been investigated. Purpose: To clarify if stringent indication for TE will better identify patients worthy of surgery and patients’ QoL. Methods: We prospectively studied the Tonsillectomy Outcome Inventory 14 (TOI-14) responses of 38 RT-patients recruited according to the S2k guideline in 2020 and compared their TOI-14 scores with those of a historical RT cohort from 2006 to 2008 and with a healthy middle-European cohort. New RT patients were assessed before, 2, 4, and 14 days and 6 months after TE. TOI-14 was measured as total and as disease-specific score. Results: From pre- to 6-month postoperative, patients’ QoL was significantly different, measured by TOI-14 (49.92 vs. 6.35; p < 0.001) and disease-specific score (60.35 vs. 9.9; p < 0.001). Preoperative disease-specific score was not different from that of the 2nd and 4th postoperative days but from the 14th postoperative day (60.35 vs. 29.26; p < 0.001). The historical cohort had significantly less RT complaints than the new cohort beforehand, but more dissatisfaction in QoL after TE.

Long-term analysis of prognostic risk factors impacting surgical outcomes in patients with external auditory canal carcinoma,"{""Background: Malignant neoplasms of the external auditory canal (EAC) are rare. No consensus on management has emerged. Objective: To determine possible risk factors influencing tumorgenesis and prognosis of EAC carcinoma. Materials and methods: 108 patients (87 men/21 women) with an average age of 74 ± 13.8 years were recruited from 2005 to 2019 at Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery Heidelberg. The follow-up interval was 43.62 ± 55.39 months. Partial and (sub)total ablative otis, supplementary surgery (petrosectomy, parotidectomy, neck dissection, mastoidectomy) and adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy belonged to treatment options. TNM status was determined at time of diagnosis using the AJCC staging system. Results: 63.9% of patients underwent a total ablative otis. Tumor recurrence was seen in 24.1%. The 1-year survival rate was 87%, the 5-year survival rate was 52%, the mean overall survival (OS) was 3.82 ± 4.6 years. Male EAC carcinoma patients had a better OS (p < 0.001), PFS (p < 0.001) and DSS (p = 0.02) than females. T1 patients had a better OS (p = 0.01), PFS (p = 0.01) and DSS (p < 0.001) than T4 patients. Lymph node but not distant metastasis, tumor grading, perineural, venous and lymphatic invasion, histology, age and tumor localization influenced the OS in EAC carcinoma patients (p = 0.04). The more radical the ablative otis, the worse the OS (p = 0.002), PFS (p = 0.02) and DSS (p < 0.001). Radio(chemo)therapy did not improve the OS.

A Short Scale to Measure Self-Reported Aversive Personality in Political Elites,"{""In order to explain the behavior of political elites, research increasingly considers personality traits. Within this line of research, a recent focus is on socially aversive–yet non-pathological–personality traits (e.g., Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy), with the idea to better understand behavior violating generally accepted ethical, moral, and social norms. Assessments of politicians’ aversive personality traits have so far been almost exclusively based on observer reports of experts and voters. Herein, by contrast, we introduce the Political Elites Aversive Personality Scale (“PEAPS”) particularly tailored to measure self-reported aversive personality among politicians. More precisely, based on two studies with German politicians, we develop a 6-item short scale comprising aspects of different socially aversive personality traits (Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and spitefulness). The scale shows an acceptable model fit, an acceptable internal consistency, an acceptable measurement equivalence, and meaningful correlations with other (self-reported) psychological traits and campaign behavior. Moreover, the scale significantly contributes to the explanation of candidates’ negative campaigning, going beyond the explanatory power of models capturing broad, basic personality traits.

Can patient-reported outcomes and inflammatory markers define endotype 2 in chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps?,"{""Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease at the clinical phenotype level (without nasal polyp [CRSsNP] vs with nasal polyp [CRSwNP]) and at the underlying inflammatory endotype level (type 2 vs non-type 2). Whether the endotype is associated with clinical presentation in patients with CRSsNP has yet to be explored in detail. Objective: To identify associations between endotypes and their clinical significance in patients with CRSsNP based on tissue interleukin-5 levels. Methods: A total of 104 patients with CRSsNP who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery between 2013 and 2017 were endotyped. We collected immunologic and clinical parameters and evaluated whether there were associations between the endotype and clinical features using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Sino-Nasal Outcome Test—22 (SNOT-22), Sniffin’ Sticks test, Lund-Mackay CT score, and nasal endoscopy. Results: Mean tissue interleukin-5 levels were used to identify type 2 inflammation (non-type 2: 3.37 vs type 2: 191.98 pg/g tissue; P < .001). There were no significant clinical differences measured by patient-reported outcome measures between patients with type 2 CRSsNP and those with non-type 2 CRSsNP preoperatively.

TSNN: A Topic and Structure Aware Neural Network for Rumor Detection,"{""Detecting rumors on social media and preventing its spread play a critical role for politics, economy, etc. Conventional studies mainly focus on exploiting the content or context of the source post, while they always ignore the rich topic information within the source post.

Can patient-reported outcomes and inflammatory markers define endotype 2 in chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps?,"{""Background: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease at the clinical phenotype level (without nasal polyp [CRSsNP] vs with nasal polyp [CRSwNP]) and at the underlying inflammatory endotype level (type 2 vs non-type 2). Whether the endotype is associated with clinical presentation in patients with CRSsNP has yet to be explored in detail. Objective: To identify associations between endotypes and their clinical significance in patients with CRSsNP based on tissue interleukin-5 levels. Methods: A total of 104 patients with CRSsNP who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery between 2013 and 2017 were endotyped. We collected immunologic and clinical parameters and evaluated whether there were associations between the endotype and clinical features using Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Sino-Nasal Outcome Test—22 (SNOT-22), Sniffin’ Sticks test, Lund-Mackay CT score, and nasal endoscopy. Results: Mean tissue interleukin-5 levels were used to identify type 2 inflammation (non-type 2: 3.37 vs type 2: 191.98 pg/g tissue; P < .001).

"Human papillomavirus prevalence and vaccine effectiveness in young women in Germany, 2017/2018: results from a nationwide study","{""Background: Infections with human papillomaviruses (HPV) are sexually transmitted and can cause cancer. In Germany, vaccination against HPV is recommended for girls and boys aged 9–17 years. We aimed to investigate HPV DNA prevalence, genotype distribution and vaccine effectiveness (VE) in women aged 20–25 years 10 years after the introduction of HPV vaccination in Germany (2018–2019), and compared these data to an equally designed study from 2010–2012. Methods: Seventy six geographical clusters were randomly selected, followed by random selection of 61 women aged 20–25 years per cluster. Participants performed cervicovaginal self-sampling and answered questions on demographics, sexual behaviour and HPV vaccination. Samples were tested for 18 high risk and nine low risk HPV genotypes. We performed chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact test, unpaired Student’s t-test and proportion t-test, and calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and 95% CIs. Results: Of 7,858 contacted women a total of 1,226 agreed to participate. Of these, 94 women were positive for HPV types 16 and/or 18. HPV16 prevalence was 7.0% (95% CI 5.6–8.6) and HPV18 prevalence was 0.8% (95% CI 0.4–1.5). HPV6 and HPV11 were rare with only five (0.4%; 0.1–0.9) and one (0%; 95% CI 0.0–0.5) positive tests. Seven hundred fifty-seven women (62%) had received at least one HPV vaccine dose and 348 (28%) were vaccinated as currently recommended. Confounder-adjusted VE was 46.4% (95% CI 4.2–70.1) against HPV16/18 infection and 49.1% (95% CI 8.2–71.8) against infection with at least one HPV genotype covered by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Compared with the 2010–2012 study results, HPV16/18 prevalence dropped from 22.5% (95% CI 19.0–26.3) to 10.3% (95% CI 7.5–13.9; p < 0.0001) in unvaccinated participants. Conclusion: Vaccine-covered HPV genotypes were rare among 20–25 years old women in Germany and decreased compared to the time point shortly after the start of the HPV vaccination program. HPV prevalence of almost all vaccine-covered genotypes was strongly reduced in vaccinated participants. A decrease of HPV16 and HPV18 was even observed in unvaccinated participants, compared to 2010–2012 data, suggesting indirect protection of unvaccinated women.

Measuring the Four Higher-Order Values in Schwartz’s Theory: Validation of a 17-Item Inventory,"{""Schwartz’s theory of basic human values is the dominant framework for assessing values. One of its strengths is that it allows for different levels of analysis.

In this paper, we examined the psychometric properties of the Higher-Order-Value Scale-17 (HOVS17), an inventory that economically assesses these higher-order values. We analyzed data from the GESIS Panel, an ongoing large-scale probability-based panel study that fields HOVS17 annually since 2013 and for which HOVS17 was originally developed. We found HOVS17 to have satisfactory psychometric properties. The 17 items were located in the two-dimensional multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) space as hypothesized. All four subscales were unidimensional, showed good fit when modeled as reflective latent variables, and had acceptable reliabilities as well as one-year test–retest stabilities (.65 to.69).

Regional differences and trends in healthy life expectancy in Germany,"{""Background: Against the background of increasing life expectancy, the question arises in which state of health the additional years of life are spent. The aim of this study is to assess for the first time regional differences in healthy life expectancy for Germany. Methods: The concept of healthy life expectancy allows for the combination of regional differences in health status and mortality in a single measure. This article uses the concept of partial healthy life expectancy. We use official data on deaths and population numbers to calculate abridged life tables. Data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) are used to determine the age- and sex-specific prevalences of health status. Regional differences are analyzed from 2002 to 2019 by dividing Germany into four regions (North, South, East, West). Results: The regional differences in healthy life expectancy in Germany are greater than differences in life expectancy, and trends in healthy life expectancy partly differ from the corresponding trends in mortality. These differences over time also vary according to age: while healthy life expectancy has tended to stagnate and, in some cases, decline among the population aged between 20 and 64, the number and proportion of years in good health has increased among older adults up to the age of 79.

"Pancultural Nostalgia in Action: Prevalence, Triggers, and Psychological Functions of Nostalgia Across Cultures","{""Nostalgia is a social, self-relevant, and bittersweet (although mostly positive) emotion that arises when reflecting on fond past memories and serves key psychological functions. The majority of evidence concerning the prevalence, triggers, and functions of nostalgia has been amassed in samples from a handful of largely Western cultures. If nostalgia is a fundamental psychological resource, it should perform similar functions across cultures, although its operational dynamics may be shaped by culture. This study (N = 2,606) examined dispositional nostalgia, self-reported triggers of nostalgia, and functions of experimentally induced nostalgia in young adults across 28 countries and a special administrative region of China (i.e., Hong Kong). Results indicated that nostalgia is frequently experienced across cultures, albeit better valued in more-developed countries (i.e., higher national wealth and life-expectancy). Nostalgia is triggered by psychological threats (especially in warmer countries), sensory stimuli (especially in more-developed countries), and social gatherings (especially in less-developed countries).

Strength of statistical evidence for the efficacy of cancer drugs: a Bayesian reanalysis of randomized trials supporting Food and Drug Administration approval,"{""Objectives: To quantify the strength of statistical evidence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for novel cancer drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the last 2 decades. Study Design and Setting: We used data on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, and tumor response for novel cancer drugs approved for the first time by the Food and Drug Administration between January 2000 and December 2020. We assessed strength of statistical evidence by calculating Bayes factors (BFs) for all available endpoints, and we pooled evidence using Bayesian fixed-effect meta-analysis for indications approved based on 2 RCTs. Strength of statistical evidence was compared among endpoints, approval pathways, lines of treatment, and types of cancer. Results: We analysed the available data from 82 RCTs corresponding to 68 indications supported by a single RCT and 7 indications supported by 2 RCTs. Median strength of statistical evidence was ambiguous for OS (BF = 1.9; interquartile range [IQR] 0.5–14.5), and strong for progression-free survival (BF = 24,767.8; IQR 109.0–7.3 × 106) and tumor response (BF = 113.9; IQR 3.0–547,100). Overall, 44 indications (58.7%) were approved without clear statistical evidence for OS improvements and 7 indications (9.3%) were approved without statistical evidence for improvements on any endpoint. Strength of statistical evidence was lower for accelerated approval compared to nonaccelerated approval across all 3 endpoints. No meaningful differences were observed for line of treatment and cancer type. This analysis is limited to statistical evidence. We did not consider nonstatistical factors (eg, risk of bias, quality of the evidence). Conclusion: BFs offer novel insights into the strength of statistical evidence underlying cancer drug approvals.

Incentives and Trust Are the Main Drivers of Recruiting Participants in 6 African Countries via Web-Based Environments: A Vignette Survey Experiment,"{""Background: In-person health surveys and biomarker collections (eg, blood testing) provide crucial data to monitor and investigate progress on health outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa. Bearing in mind that administrative sampling frames are often outdated and financial resources can be limited, it is of substantial policy importance to better understand whether recruitment of individuals for in-person health data collection efforts can be accomplished via web-based environments such as social media sites. Yet, there is little methodological research on (1) the feasibility of recruitment through web-based environments and (2) the factors that drive in-person survey participation rates in sub-Saharan Africa countries. Objective: This study aimed to share our experimental results on the recruitment of individuals from sub-Saharan Africa for participation in in-person, health-related surveys and biomarker collections via Facebook ads and to provide recommendations for future data collections and research. Methods: We conducted a preregistered 2×4×4 vignette experiment to investigate people’s willingness to participate in in-person health surveys and blood tests. The experiment was part of a web survey (n≈10,600) of individuals recruited via Facebook advertisements that we conducted in early 2023 in 6 sub-Saharan Africa countries (Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda). Based on the theories of contextual integrity, economic participation, and social exchange, three factors were varied: (1) the topic (HIV or diabetes), (2) the incentive (US $0, US $2 cash, US $2 voucher, and US $2 lottery), and (3) the sponsor (nongovernmental organization, statistical office, health ministry, or local university). Results: Overall, we found that a majority of survey participants are willing to participate in in-person health surveys and provide biomarkers (vignette means range between 5.54 and 6.09 on a 1 to 7 scale). First, providing a financial incentive significantly increased the likelihood of being willing to participate (b=.180, .188, and .200; all P<.001). Second, individuals with high levels of trust in nongovernmental organizations or the health ministry were more likely to be willing to participate (b=.086 and .048; both P<.001). In contrast, 2 factors (topic and sponsor) showed mainly non-significant effects (b=.010, P=.63; b=.041, P=.18; b=.042, P=.19; b=.063, P=.05). Other factors that were related to an increase in willingness to participate included fertility levels (having children), risk-taking, having an illness (HIV, diabetes), better general health, social trust, trust in science, survey enjoyment, survey value, and cognitive skills. Conclusions: Together, the study’s results suggest that using a web-based environment for recruiting health research participants in sub-Saharan Africa can be a viable option and emphasize the importance of adequate compensation and trust in the sponsor.

Scoring German Alternate Uses Items Applying Large Language Models,"{""The alternate uses task (AUT) is the most popular measure when it comes to the assessment of creative potential.

Patient-Specific Factors to Differentiate Between Branchial Cleft Cysts and CUP Syndrome: A 10 Year Unicenter Study,"{""Objectives: Due to its generally-poor prognosis and varied clinical presentation, cervical cancer of unknown primary (CUP) poses particular challenges for clinical and imaging diagnosis. Differential diagnoses of CUP syndrome may also include lateral cervical cysts. When a benign neck cyst is initially suspected, squamous cell carcinoma is often diagnosed after receiving histopathology. Our study investigates the risk factors to differentiate between CUP syndrome and lateral neck cysts (LNC) to possibly improve the prognosis. Methods: Between 2013 and 2023, 244 patients with an initial diagnosis of LNC (n = 121) or CUP (n = 123) were recruited from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Heidelberg University Hospital and underwent panendoscopy with lymph node removal. In general, disease- and progression-free survival, prognostic relevant risk factors, and treatment data were recorded and analyzed. Results: The mean age of patients with CUP was significantly higher at 65 ± 13.2 years than that of patients with LNC (41 ± 15.8 years; P =.000). The calculated cutoff value was 50 to 59 years for a 50% chance of CUP syndrome or other malignant neck mass. Alcohol and tobacco consumption were not found to be risk factors. Previous tumor diseases were diagnosed more frequently in patients with CUP than in patients with LNC (P =.045). The 5 year overall survival for patients with CUP was 77.0% and did not differ significantly between the other various tumor entities (P =.423). Conclusions: The consideration of patient-specific factors such as age or synchronous/asynchronous malignancies is crucial in the diagnostic decision-making process. In the age group of 50 to 59 years, there is ~50% probability of diagnosing CUP syndrome with unilateral painless neck swelling.

The incidence of carcinoma in initially benign treated neck cysts is estimated to be as high as 24 %. The objective of this study was to ascertain the malignancy rate of cystic cervical masses and to provide a differentiation of cervical metastases in comparison to benign cervical cysts, utilising current guidelines. Material and Methods Between 2013 and 2023, a total of 155 patients with a suspected diagnosis of lateral neck cyst were recruited at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at our University Hospital. All patients underwent cyst removal, either alone or in conjunction with panendoscopy. Results A histologically confirmed ipsilateral lymph node metastasis was identified in 21.9 % of patients. The mean age of patients with malignant neck masses was significantly higher than that of patients with benign neck masses (64.0 ± 12.8 versus 41.0 ± 15.8; p < 0.001). The probability of malignancy was low in patients younger than 54 years (11 %), but increased markedly to 80 % in the age group of 60-69 years. The clinical sensitivity for initial suspicion of a benign neck cyst was 60.3%, while the specificity was 48.7%. Conclusions An individualized approach is necessary for the early diagnosis and treatment of unilateral neck cysts, as this condition requires a multifaceted assessment based on the patient’s medical history, clinical findings, imaging, and clinical expertise.

Legacy of the GDR: regional disparities in childhood maltreatment in post-unification Germany,"{""Background: Previous research has identified growing up in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) as a protective factor against childhood abuse and neglect compared to growing up in the former Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). This study investigates whether these differences persist among individuals born after German reunification, providing a novel focus on the post-unification generation and the possible transgenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment in Germany. Method: The prevalence of self-reported abusive and neglected childhood experiences among 17- to 31-year-olds, stratified by gender and socio-political context (East/West), was examined using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Data of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KIGGS-study) between 2014 and 2017 was used. Logistic regression models were used to assess the influence of covariates such as age, subjective social status, and education on childhood trauma experiences. Results: Altogether, 18.6% (East = 15.8%/ West = 19.0%) of the N = 5,982 participants reported at least one type of maltreatment. The prevalence of at least moderate abuse was found to be 6.8% (East = 5.8%/West = 7.0%) for emotional, 3.7% (East = 2.4%/West = 3.9%) for physical, and 3.3% (East = 1.9%/West = 3.6%) for sexual abuse, and a prevalence of 9.2% (East = 8.5%/West = 9.3%) for emotional and 8.7% (East = 7.4%/West = 8.9%) for physical neglect. Individuals residing in eastern German regions reported significant lower prevalence rates for sexual and physical abuse, as well as overall maltreatment. Conclusion: Significant regional disparities in childhood maltreatment were observed among individuals raised in post-unification Germany, suggesting the persistence of sociopolitical influences from the former GDR as a protective factor.
