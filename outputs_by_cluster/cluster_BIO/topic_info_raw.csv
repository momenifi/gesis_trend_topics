birth before / after january 1 st, 1980). methods to investigate these questions, the data from a representative survey in the new federal states of n=2729 people as well as the data from a second online based survey of people from the new and old federal states as well as internal migrants with a total of n=4789 participants were evaluated. results there was a prevalence of 1% for the use of psychotherapy during the gdr era. overall, the prevalence of therapy experiences among people who experienced the gdr and were born before january 1 st in 1980 was almost 13%. they also reported greater willingness seeking help for mental suffering since the end of the cold war. the prevalence among younger people was about 12%. in the second survey, there were significant differences, among the older respondents. east germans today and even during the gdr era were less willing to seek psychotherapy for mental suffering, they also have less contact to mentally ill people. differences according to desires for distance from mentally ill people, self stigmatization in the presence of a mental illness and discrimination against mentally ill people emerged between east germans, west germans and internal migrants depending on generational affiliation. discussion barriers that prevent the use of psychotherapy should be taken into account on a generational and socialization specific basis. socialization as a relevant factor might explain a lack of willingness to utilize psychotherapy amongst people that experienced the gdr era and still live in the new federal states.', 'background: infections with human papillomaviruses (hpv) are sexually transmitted and can cause cancer. in germany, vaccination against hpv is recommended for girls and boys aged 9–17 years. we aimed to investigate hpv dna prevalence, genotype distribution and vaccine effectiveness (ve) in women aged 20–25 years 10 years after the introduction of hpv vaccination in germany (2018–2019), and compared these data to an equally designed study from 2010–2012. methods: seventy six geographical clusters were randomly selected, followed by random selection of 61 women aged 20–25 years per cluster. participants performed cervicovaginal self-sampling and answered questions on demographics, sexual behaviour and hpv vaccination. samples were tested for 18 high risk and nine low risk hpv genotypes. we performed chi-square tests, fisher’s exact test, unpaired student’s t-test and proportion t-test, and calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (pr) and 95% cis. results: of 7,858 contacted women a total of 1,226 agreed to participate. of these, 94 women were positive for hpv types 16 and/or 18. hpv16 prevalence was 7.0% (95% ci 5.6–8.6) and hpv18 prevalence was 0.8% (95% ci 0.4–1.5). hpv6 and hpv11 were rare with only five (0.4%; 0.1–0.9) and one (0%; 95% ci 0.0–0.5) positive tests. seven hundred fifty-seven women (62%) had received at least one hpv vaccine dose and 348 (28%) were vaccinated as currently recommended. confounder-adjusted ve was 46.4% (95% ci 4.2–70.1) against hpv16/18 infection and 49.1% (95% ci 8.2–71.8) against infection with at least one hpv genotype covered by the quadrivalent hpv vaccine. compared with the 2010–2012 study results, hpv16/18 prevalence dropped from 22.5% (95% ci 19.0–26.3) to 10.3% (95% ci 7.5–13.9; p < 0.0001) in unvaccinated participants. conclusion: vaccine-covered hpv genotypes were rare among 20–25 years old women in germany and decreased compared to the time point shortly after the start of the hpv vaccination program. hpv prevalence of almost all vaccine-covered genotypes was strongly reduced in vaccinated participants. a decrease of hpv16 and hpv18 was even observed in unvaccinated participants, compared to 2010–2012 data, suggesting indirect protection of unvaccinated women. low ve against hpv16/18 and hpv6/11/16/18 in our study might be attributable to study design in combination with the endpoint selection of (mainly transient) hpv dna positivity.']"

positive and weak results were confirmed with real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). results: recruitment was conducted between november 18 and december 11, 2020. the response rates in the 4 arms varied between 34.31% (2340/6821) and 41.17% (2043/4962). the prescreening classified 16.61% (1207/7266) of the patients as covid-19 symptomatic. altogether, 4232 persons without prescreening and 7623 participating in the prescreening provided 5351 gargle samples, of which 5319 (99.4%) could be analyzed. this yielded 17 confirmed sars-cov-2 infections and a combined prevalence of 0.36% (95% ci 0.14%-0.59%) in the arms without prescreening and 0.05% (95% ci 0.00%-0.108%) in the arms with prescreening (initial contacts only). specifically, we found a prevalence of 0.31% (95% ci 0.06%-0.58%) for individuals and 0.35% (95% ci 0.09%-0.61%) for households, and lower estimates with prescreening (0.07%, 95% ci 0.0%-0.15% for individuals and 0.02%, 95% ci 0.0%-0.06% for households). asymptomatic infections occurred in 27% (3/11) of the positive cases with symptom data. the 2 arms without prescreening performed the best regarding effectiveness and accuracy. conclusions: this study showed that postal mailing of gargle sample kits and returning home-based self-collected liquid gargle samples followed by high-sensitivity rt-lamp analysis is a feasible way to conduct active sars-cov-2 population surveillance without burdening routine diagnostic testing. efforts to improve participation rates and integration into the public health system may increase the potential to monitor the course of the pandemic.', 'background: the covid-19 pandemic is characterized by rapid increases in infection burden owing to the emergence of new variants with higher transmissibility and immune escape. to date, monitoring the covid-19 pandemic has mainly relied on passive surveillance, yielding biased epidemiological measures owing to the disproportionate number of undetected asymptomatic cases. active surveillance could provide accurate estimates of the true prevalence to forecast the evolution of the pandemic, enabling evidence-based decision-making. objective: this study compared 4 different approaches of active sars-cov-2 surveillance focusing on feasibility and epidemiological outcomes. methods: a 2-factor factorial randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2020 in a german district with 700,000 inhabitants. the epidemiological outcome comprised sars-cov-2 prevalence and its precision. the 4 study arms combined 2 factors: individuals versus households and direct testing versus testing conditioned on symptom prescreening. individuals aged ≥7 years were eligible. altogether, 27,908 addresses from 51 municipalities were randomly allocated to the arms and 15 consecutive recruitment weekdays. data collection and logistics were highly digitized, and a website in 5 languages enabled low-barrier registration and tracking of results. gargle sample collection kits were sent by post. participants collected a gargle sample at home and mailed it to the laboratory. samples were analyzed with reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (rt-lamp);
