all p<.001). second, individuals with high levels of trust in nongovernmental organizations or the health ministry were more likely to be willing to participate (b=.086 and .048; both p<.001). in contrast, 2 factors (topic and sponsor) showed mainly non-significant effects (b=.010, p=.63; b=.041, p=.18; b=.042, p=.19; b=.063, p=.05). other factors that were related to an increase in willingness to participate included fertility levels (having children), risk-taking, having an illness (hiv, diabetes), better general health, social trust, trust in science, survey enjoyment, survey value, and cognitive skills. conclusions: together, the study’s results suggest that using a web-based environment for recruiting health research participants in sub-saharan africa can be a viable option and emphasize the importance of adequate compensation and trust in the sponsor. the findings also indicated that several attitudinal but almost none of the sociodemographic variables are systematically related to the willingness to participate in health-related in-person data collection activities.', 'background: previous research has identified growing up in the former german democratic republic (gdr) as a protective factor against childhood abuse and neglect compared to growing up in the former federal republic of germany (frg). this study investigates whether these differences persist among individuals born after german reunification, providing a novel focus on the post-unification generation and the possible transgenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment in germany. method: the prevalence of self-reported abusive and neglected childhood experiences among 17- to 31-year-olds, stratified by gender and socio-political context (east/west), was examined using the childhood trauma questionnaire (ctq). data of the german health interview and examination survey for children and adolescents (kiggs-study) between 2014 and 2017 was used. logistic regression models were used to assess the influence of covariates such as age, subjective social status, and education on childhood trauma experiences. results: altogether, 18.6% (east = 15.8%/ west = 19.0%) of the n = 5,982 participants reported at least one type of maltreatment. the prevalence of at least moderate abuse was found to be 6.8% (east = 5.8%/west = 7.0%) for emotional, 3.7% (east = 2.4%/west = 3.9%) for physical, and 3.3% (east = 1.9%/west = 3.6%) for sexual abuse, and a prevalence of 9.2% (east = 8.5%/west = 9.3%) for emotional and 8.7% (east = 7.4%/west = 8.9%) for physical neglect. individuals residing in eastern german regions reported significant lower prevalence rates for sexual and physical abuse, as well as overall maltreatment. conclusion: significant regional disparities in childhood maltreatment were observed among individuals raised in post-unification germany, suggesting the persistence of sociopolitical influences from the former gdr as a protective factor. these findings underscore the importance of understanding transgenerational transmission factors of childhood maltreatment, such as parenting behaviors within differing sociopolitical contexts. the results have important implications for child welfare policies, emphasizing the need to address regional disparities and to incorporate historical and sociopolitical factors into future research and intervention strategies.', 'background: infections with human papillomaviruses (hpv) are sexually transmitted and can cause cancer. in germany, vaccination against hpv is recommended for girls and boys aged 9–17 years. we aimed to investigate hpv dna prevalence, genotype distribution and vaccine effectiveness (ve) in women aged 20–25 years 10 years after the introduction of hpv vaccination in germany (2018–2019), and compared these data to an equally designed study from 2010–2012. methods: seventy six geographical clusters were randomly selected, followed by random selection of 61 women aged 20–25 years per cluster. participants performed cervicovaginal self-sampling and answered questions on demographics, sexual behaviour and hpv vaccination. samples were tested for 18 high risk and nine low risk hpv genotypes. we performed chi-square tests, fisher’s exact test, unpaired student’s t-test and proportion t-test, and calculated crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (pr) and 95% cis. results: of 7,858 contacted women a total of 1,226 agreed to participate. of these, 94 women were positive for hpv types 16 and/or 18. hpv16 prevalence was 7.0% (95% ci 5.6–8.6) and hpv18 prevalence was 0.8% (95% ci 0.4–1.5). hpv6 and hpv11 were rare with only five (0.4%; 0.1–0.9) and one (0%; 95% ci 0.0–0.5) positive tests. seven hundred fifty-seven women (62%) had received at least one hpv vaccine dose and 348 (28%) were vaccinated as currently recommended. confounder-adjusted ve was 46.4% (95% ci 4.2–70.1) against hpv16/18 infection and 49.1% (95% ci 8.2–71.8) against infection with at least one hpv genotype covered by the quadrivalent hpv vaccine. compared with the 2010–2012 study results, hpv16/18 prevalence dropped from 22.5% (95% ci 19.0–26.3) to 10.3% (95% ci 7.5–13.9; p < 0.0001) in unvaccinated participants. conclusion: vaccine-covered hpv genotypes were rare among 20–25 years old women in germany and decreased compared to the time point shortly after the start of the hpv vaccination program. hpv prevalence of almost all vaccine-covered genotypes was strongly reduced in vaccinated participants. a decrease of hpv16 and hpv18 was even observed in unvaccinated participants, compared to 2010–2012 data, suggesting indirect protection of unvaccinated women. low ve against hpv16/18 and hpv6/11/16/18 in our study might be attributable to study design in combination with the endpoint selection of (mainly transient) hpv dna positivity.']"
