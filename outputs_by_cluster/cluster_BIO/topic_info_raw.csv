findings {we empirically explore whether perceptions of (in)determinism are related to the willingness to tolerate uncertainty. we argue that the belief in indeterminism supports a sense of personal autonomy and independence from external influence, a stance that provides protection from perceived uncertainties. our preliminary study (n = 61) suggests that the belief in an indeterminate world is positively associated with uncertainty tolerance, whereas beliefs in free will and metaphysical dualism are not. we extend these findings by examining proxies of indeterminism belief in a cross-national dataset (n = 31 countries). we find that greater political and personal freedom is associated with higher tolerance for uncertainty, whereas religious belief, which posits a world determined by divine powers, is negatively associated with uncertainty tolerance. with these theoretical ideas and empirical findings, we hope to stimulate research to further advance our understanding of the association between belief in indeterminism and tolerating uncertainty.} {autonomy,causality,indeterminism,tolerance,uncertainty}

growing up in the former german democratic republic (gdr) as a protective factor against childhood abuse and neglect compared to growing up in the former federal republic of germany (frg). this study investigates whether these differences persist among individuals born after german reunification, providing a novel focus on the post-unification generation and the possible transgenerational transmission of childhood maltreatment in germany. method: the prevalence of self-reported abusive and neglected childhood experiences among 17- to 31-year-olds, stratified by gender and socio-political context (east/west), was examined using the childhood trauma questionnaire (ctq). data of the german health interview and examination survey for children and adolescents (kiggs-study) between 2014 and 2017 was used. logistic regression models were used to assess the influence of covariates such as age, subjective social status, and education on childhood trauma experiences. results: altogether, 18.6% (east = 15.8%/ west = 19.0%) of the n = 5,982 participants reported at least one type of maltreatment. the prevalence of at least moderate abuse was found to be 6.8% (east = 5.8%/west = 7.0%) for emotional, 3.7% (east = 2.4%/west = 3.9%) for physical, and 3.3% (east = 1.9%/west = 3.6%) for sexual abuse, and a prevalence of 9.2% (east = 8.5%/west = 9.3%) for emotional and 8.7% (east = 7.4%/west = 8.9%) for physical neglect. individuals residing in eastern german regions reported significant lower prevalence rates for sexual and physical abuse, as well as overall maltreatment. conclusion: significant regional disparities in childhood maltreatment were observed among individuals raised in post-unification germany, suggesting the persistence of sociopolitical influences from the former gdr as a protective factor. these findings underscore the importance of understanding transgenerational transmission factors of childhood maltreatment, such as parenting behaviors within differing sociopolitical contexts. the results have important implications for child welfare policies, emphasizing the need to address regional disparities and to incorporate
