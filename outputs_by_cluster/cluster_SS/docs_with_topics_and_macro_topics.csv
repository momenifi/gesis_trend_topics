Comparing participation motives of professional and non-professional respondents,"{In times of declining response rates and over-surveying, improving our understanding of why people participate in surveys is more important than ever. Previous research showed that online panel participants have intrinsic (e.g., topic interest, altruism) and extrinsic (e.g., incentives) participation reasons. Our study expands this research by implementing an experiment using two common forms of survey measurement: ranking and rating. The experiment was fielded in a professional respondents’ sample from a German online panel (n = 407) and in an address-based sample (mail and online) of German non-professional respondents (n = 1,137). Besides extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, the experiment included various study design features (i.e., mode, length, data security) and the mood during the time of contact as possible reasons for participation. The results confirm previous findings regarding the motivations of online panelists but also show important differences between professional and non-professional respondents. Specifically, the main participation reasons of professionals are topic interest (intrinsic) and incentives (extrinsic), while non-professionals are primarily motivated by intrinsic reasons (topic interest and purpose of study). This notion is also supported by the Latent Class Analyses, which showed that three of the four classes for professional respondents had a high probability of naming incentives as one of their main reasons for survey participation, whereas none of the four non-professional clusters rated incentives highly. The differences between the two samples highlight that professional panel members have different motivation structures than participants in general population surveys.

Patterns and Predictors of Literacy and Numeracy Development During Adulthood: Insights from Two Longitudinal Assessment Surveys,"{Literacy (reading competence) and numeracy (mathematical competence) are indispensable prerequisites for lifelong learning and participation in today’s knowledge-based societies. However, evidence on the development of these competencies during adulthood is limited.

Both surveys offer repeated measures of adults’ competencies spaced 3–6 years apart, allowing light to be cast on two guiding questions: (1) Patterns of change: Can literacy and numeracy still change in adulthood? If so, does change involve gains or losses, and how is change distributed across sociodemographic subgroups? (2) Predictors of change: Which individual and contextual factors (e.g., participation in job-related training, engagement in literacy or numeracy practice, or basic cognitive skills) predict change in competence development? Findings suggest that competencies continue to develop across the lifespan and can change even over relatively short time periods. Gains and losses occur in equal measure.

User-centric approaches for collecting Facebook data in the ‘post-API age’: experiences from two studies and recommendations for future research,"{Although other social media platforms have seen a steeper increase in users recently, Facebook is still the social networking site with the largest number of users worldwide.

Here, we analyzed data from 11 darknet markets for the period Jan-2014 and Sep-2015. The findings suggest that darknet markets harbor similar counterfeit product types to those found in seizures but that the share of watches is higher while the share of electronics, clothes, shoes, and Tobacco is lower on darknet markets. Also, darknet market counterfeits seem to have similar shipping origins as seized goods, with some exceptions, such as a relatively high share (5%) of dark market counterfeits originating from the US. Lastly, counterfeits on dark markets tend to have a relatively low price and sales volume. However, based on preliminary estimations, the equivalent products on the surface web appear to be advertised for a multiple of the prices found for darknet markets. We provide some suggestions on how information about darknet market counterfeits could be used by companies and authorities for preventative purposes, showing that insight gathering from the dark web is valuable and could be a cost-effective alternative (or compliment) to border seizures.

HOW DOES BACK TRANSLATION FARE AGAINST TEAM TRANSLATION?

The final translations from both approaches were assessed, with a focus on how translation issues, such as mistranslations or wording issues identified in the initial translations were addressed. While none of the twenty-nine issues in the initial translation were present in the final team translation version, twenty-two of these issues were still present in the final version after the back-translation approach. For a selected number of items, we also ran a split-ballot experiment in a web survey.

In sum, the final translation from the team approach clearly outperformed the final translation from the back-translation approach when it comes to text-based criteria (in particular, accuracy and fluency). The quantitative test showed that many translation issues (those remaining in the translation after the back translation step) had no effect on the estimates.

Bringing the political system (back) into social tipping relevant to sustainability,"{Recently, social tipping dynamics relevant to sustainability have become the subject of a growing literature.

Yet, and despite its wide array, the current literature has a blind spot: it does neither adequately integrate, conceptualize, nor measure the role of the political sphere and thus underestimates its importance for social tipping processes. This is the starting point of our contribution, which not only emphasizes the political dimension's relevance to the analysis of social tipping, but also proposes two main ways to integrate it into such analyses: by conceptualizing the political sphere either as a trigger of social tipping, or as an element that can tip itself. Moreover, to capture the complexity of the political sphere, namely the interaction between networks, actors, and processes, we suggest analysing the political sphere along its three elements: polity, politics, and policy.

Satisficing Response Behavior Across Time: Assessing Negative Panel Conditioning Using an Experimental Design with Six Repetitions,"{Satisficing response behavior can be a threat to the quality of survey responses.

We use data from a longitudinal survey experiment comprising six panel waves administered within a German non-probability online access panel. To investigate the underlying mechanism of possible learning effects, the experimental study randomly assigned respondents to different frequencies of receiving identical question contents over the six panel waves.

Establishing standards for human-annotated samples applied in supervised machine learning - Evidence from a Monte Carlo simulation,"{Automated content analyses have become a popular tool in communication science.

We argue that a loss in prediction accuracy in supervised machine learning builds up over this two-stage procedure. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we tested (1) human coder errors (random, individual systematic, joint systematic) and (2) curation strategies for human-annotated datasets (one coder per document, majority rule, full agreement) as two sequential sources of accuracy loss of automated content analysis. Coder agreement prior to conducting manual content analysis remains an important quality criterion for automated content analyses.

Children and youth at risk in times of transition: International and interdisciplinary perspectives,"{Children and youth belong to one of the most vulnerable groups in societies. This was the case even before the current humanitarian crises around the world which led millions of people and families to flee from wars, terror, poverty and exploitation. Minors have been denied human rights such as access to education, food and health services. They have been kidnapped, sold, manipulated, mutilated, killed, and injured. This has been and continues to be the case in both developed and developing countries, and it does not look as if the situation will improve in the near future. Rather, current geopolitical developments, political and economic uncertainties and instabilities seem to be increasing the vulnerability of minors, especially in the wars and armed conflicts currently being waged not only in Europe, but on almost every continent. How can risks children and youth are exposed to in times of transition be reduced? Which role do state agencies, non-governmental organisations, as well as children's coping strategies play in mitigating the vulnerabilities of minors?

Establishing standards for human-annotated samples applied in supervised machine learning - Evidence from a Monte Carlo simulation,"{Automated content analyses have become a popular tool in communication science. While standard procedures for manual content analysis were established decades ago, it remains an open question whether these standards are sufficient for the use of human-annotated data to train supervised machine learning models. Scholars typically follow a two-stage procedure to obtain high prediction accuracy: manual content analysis followed by model training with human-annotated samples. We argue that a loss in prediction accuracy in supervised machine learning builds up over this two-stage procedure. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we tested (1) human coder errors (random, individual systematic, joint systematic) and (2) curation strategies for human-annotated datasets (one coder per document, majority rule, full agreement) as two sequential sources of accuracy loss of automated content analysis. Coder agreement prior to conducting manual content analysis remains an important quality criterion for automated content analyses. A Krippendorff's alpha of at least 0.8 is desirable to achieve satisfying prediction results after machine learning. Systematic errors (individual and joint) must be avoided at all costs.

Intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: A question of gender and parenting style?,"{“Left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. But how do political ideological attitudes emerge? One central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. However, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. Nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the European context. This paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. Hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? How does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? These questions are examined using the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and Entrepreneurship (CUPESSE) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. First, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 European countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. Furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. The results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. It also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.}",2023,Frontiers in Political Science,"{intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",Public Administration,Social Sciences,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2023,"intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: a question of gender and parenting style? {“left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. but how do political ideological attitudes emerge? one central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. however, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the european context. this paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? how does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? these questions are examined using the cultural pathways to economic self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship (cupesse) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. first, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 european countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. the results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. it also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.} {intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth} {intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",-1,0.0022013956776228923,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe"

Issue trade-offs and the politics of representation: Experimental evidence from four European democracies,"{The politics of representation has become increasingly complex in recent years. Amid weakening traditional political cleavages, the emergence of new political divides and mounting anti-elitism that have helped the rise of radical populist parties, voters face significant cross-pressures when casting their ballots. Despite a wealth of studies on the role of issue preferences in voting behaviour, there are still many unknowns when it comes to understanding how voters trade off competing issue preferences against each other. Studying issue trade-offs is also important against the backdrop of the well-documented preferences of radical left and right voters for redistribution and restrictive immigration policies, respectively. To investigate the strength of issue preferences among radical left, radical right and mainstream party voters and the willingness to compromise on their most important issues, we conducted a conjoint survey experiment with 2,000 participants in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The voting scenario in the experiment featured proposals on salient political issues and different (non)populist stances on political representation. The results from the cross-country study, as well as a large replication study with a sample of 4,000 German respondents, show that voters of radical right parties are willing to accept large trade-offs regarding their other issue preferences as long as their preference for restrictive immigration policies is fulfilled. Differently, radical left, Green and mainstream party voters have a more variegated range of issue preferences, some of them so strong that they are not traded off for their preferred redistribution and European Union integration positions, respectively. The findings shed light on trade-offs related to emerging issues such as climate change and the distinct logics behind support for radical parties.

Multi-label classification of open-ended questions with BERT,"{Open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. However, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. Traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. In the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. Most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. However, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. This paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. Here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. We evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the German language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES Panel (N=17,584, 55 labels). We evaluate the algorithms on 0/1 loss. We find that classification with BERT (forcing at least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered (18.9%-21.6%). Our work has important implications for social scientists: 1) Multi-label classification with BERT works in the German language for open-ends. 2) For mildly multi-label classification tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic classification.

Left behind in a public services wasteland? On the accessibility of public services and political trust,"{Public discourse and scholars alike argue that the spatial divide in voting behavior and attitudes is rooted in geographic inequalities that serve as breeding grounds for political discontent.

I argue that the accessibility of public service infrastructure specifically serves as a low-intensity information cue for citizens to evaluate the political performance of modern welfare states. These evaluations complement objective economic perceptions and are part of the performance-trust link.

"Sharing social media data: The role of past experiences, attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control","{Social media data (SMD) have become an important data source in the social sciences. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the experiences and practices of researchers working with SMD in their research and gain insights into researchers' sharing behavior and influencing factors for their decisions. To achieve these aims, we conducted a survey study among researchers working with SMD. The questionnaire covered different topics related to accessing, (re)using, and sharing SMD. To examine attitudes toward data sharing, perceived subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, we used questions based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). We employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses.

Evaluating an Alternative Frame for Address-Based Sampling in Germany: The Address Database From Deutsche Post Direkt,"{In Germany, the population registers with addresses of individuals can be used for address-based sampling. However, unlike countries with a centralized register, municipalities in Germany administer their registers themselves.

If substitute municipalities are not available, other sampling methods are required. The present study tested the feasibility of using the address database from Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously conducted two almost identical surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of equal size (N = 3,000). One sample was drawn from the city’s population register, the other from the commercial ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD could be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules. However, these benefits come at considerable cost. First, the use of the ADB-DPD is limited to self-administered surveys.

Explaining cheating in schools with Situational Action Theory: Within-estimations using a German school panel,"{Wikström's Situational Action Theory (SAT) explains rule-breaking by reference to the cognitive perception-choice process, which indicates how a person's propensity to break rules interacts with the setting's criminogeneity. SAT's situational model claims that the interaction between personal morality and the moral norms of the setting, the so-called moral filter, is critical in the explanation of rule-breaking, and that the influence of self-control is subordinate to this process. Self-control becomes relevant when individuals whose personal morality discourages rule-breaking are exposed to settings in which the moral norms encourage rule-breaking, that is, if the moral filter is conflicted. Whereas most previous studies have equated the moral filter with personal morality, we consider the moral norms of the setting as well. This allows for a more rigorous test of the moral filter, and thus the conditionality of self-control. Here, we investigate student cheating, using data from two waves of a large-scale German school panel study, and we conceptualise the setting's moral norms by reference to the descriptive norm: other students’ cheating behaviour. This ensures the spatio-linkage between the setting's criminogeneity and rule-breaking, which is necessary for investigating SAT. Additionally, our estimation strategy – person and school fixed-effect models – controls for alternative explanations by the selection of people into settings with different levels of criminogeneity. Moreover, it controls for heterogeneity across persons and schools. The findings are in line with SAT's predictions. In cases of a correspondence between personal morality and the moral norms of a setting, students with rule-abiding morality are least likely to cheat, whereas students with a rule-breaking morality are the most likely to cheat.

River Sampling – a Fishing Expedition: A Non-Probability Case Study,"{The ease with which large amounts of data can be collected via the Internet has led to a renewed interest in the use of non-probability samples. To that end, this paper performs a case study, comparing two non-probability datasets – one based on a river-sampling approach, one drawn from an online-access panel – to a reference probability sample. Of particular interest is the single-question river-sampling approach, as the data collected for this study presents an attempt to field a multi-item scale with such a sampling method. Each dataset consists of the same psychometric measures for two of the Big-5 personality traits, which are expected to perform independently of sample composition.

Evaluating an Alternative Frame for Address-Based Sampling in Germany: The Address Database From Deutsche Post Direkt,"{In Germany, the population registers with addresses of individuals can be used for address-based sampling. However, unlike countries with a centralized register, municipalities in Germany administer their registers themselves. This not only makes sampling for a nationwide survey more costly and cumbersome but may also result in gaps in the gross sample, as selected municipalities may refuse to allow their registers to be used for sampling purposes. If substitute municipalities are not available, other sampling methods are required. The present study tested the feasibility of using the address database from Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously conducted two almost identical surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of equal size (N = 3,000). One sample was drawn from the city’s population register, the other from the commercial ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD could be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules. However, these benefits come at considerable cost. First, the use of the ADB-DPD is limited to self-administered surveys.

Multi-label classification of open-ended questions with BERT,"{Open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. However, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. Traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. In the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. Most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. However, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. This paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. Here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. We evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the German language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES Panel (N=17,584, 55 labels).

Digitalisation as a Prospect for Work–Life Balance and Inclusion: A Natural Experiment in German Hospitals,"{Digitalisation has a wide range of impacts on the workplace, such as enabling new work models with flexible work sched-ules, changing work content, or increasing workplace control.

Focusing on the German healthcare sector, I explore the impact of using networked digital technologies on work–life balance, and whether it influences gender and educational inequalities. Pressured by government, economic concerns, and medical innovation, this sector is undergoing a transformation process that is expediting the introduction of new networked digital technologies. Thus, it provides an ideal setting for empirical investigation, as one core assumption about digitalisation is that technological innovation at work has societal consequences that must be individually mastered.

Establishing standards for human-annotated samples applied in supervised machine learning - Evidence from a Monte Carlo simulation,"{Automated content analyses have become a popular tool in communication science. While standard procedures for manual content analysis were established decades ago, it remains an open question whether these standards are sufficient for the use of human-annotated data to train supervised machine learning models.

We argue that a loss in prediction accuracy in supervised machine learning builds up over this two-stage procedure. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we tested (1) human coder errors (random, individual systematic, joint systematic) and (2) curation strategies for human-annotated datasets (one coder per document, majority rule, full agreement) as two sequential sources of accuracy loss of automated content analysis.

Evaluating an Alternative Frame for Address-Based Sampling in Germany: The Address Database From Deutsche Post Direkt,"{In Germany, the population registers with addresses of individuals can be used for address-based sampling.

The present study tested the feasibility of using the address database from Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously conducted two almost identical surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of equal size (N = 3,000). One sample was drawn from the city’s population register, the other from the commercial ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD could be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules.

Left behind in a public services wasteland? On the accessibility of public services and political trust,"{Public discourse and scholars alike argue that the spatial divide in voting behavior and attitudes is rooted in geographic inequalities that serve as breeding grounds for political discontent. In previous studies, scholars have mainly focused on the economic conditions to analyze how place-based context influences the voting behavior of citizens. However, this focus on voting behavior and a small set of contextual variables do not allow us to draw direct conclusions as to how, and which, place-based factors relate to discontent on the attitudinal level. I argue that the accessibility of public service infrastructure specifically serves as a low-intensity information cue for citizens to evaluate the political performance of modern welfare states. These evaluations complement objective economic perceptions and are part of the performance-trust link.

The effects of data harmonization on the survey research process,"{The chapter provides a general introduction to the role of data harmonization in all aspects of the survey research process.

Justice Evaluation of the Income Distribution (JEID): Development and validation of a short scale for the subjective assessment of objective differences in earnings,"{Justice evaluations are proposed to provide a link between the objective level of inequality and the consequences at the individual and societal level. Available instruments, however, focus on the subjective perception of inequality and income distributions. In light of findings that subjective perceptions of inequality and income levels can be biased and subject to method effects, we present the newly developed Justice Evaluation of the Income Distribution (JEID) Scale, which captures justice evaluations of the actual earnings distribution. JEID comprises five items that provide respondents with earnings information for five groups at different segments along the distribution of earnings in a given country. We provide a German-language and an English-language version of the scale. The German-language version was developed and validated based on three comprehensive heterogeneous quota samples from Germany; the translated English-language version was validated in one comprehensive heterogeneous quota sample from the UK. Using latent profile analysis and k-means clustering, we identified three typical response patterns, which we labeled “inequality averse,” “bottom-inequality averse,” and “status quo justification.” JEID was found to be related to normative orientations in the sense that egalitarian views were associated with stronger injustice evaluations at the bottom and top ends of the earnings distribution.

Evaluating Transferability in Multilingual Text Analyses,"{Multilingual text analysis is increasingly important to address the current narrow focus of English and other Indo-European languages in comparative studies. However, there has been a lack of a comprehensive approach to evaluate the validity of multilingual text analytic methods across different language contexts. To address this issue, we propose that the validity of multilingual text analysis should be studied through the lens of transferability, which assesses the extent to which the performance of a multilingual text analytic method can be maintained when switching from one language context to another. We first formally conceptualize transferability in multilingual text analysis as a measure of whether the method is equivalent across language groups (linguistic transferability) and societal contexts (contextual transferability). We propose a model-agnostic approach to evaluate transferability using (1) natural and synthetic data pairs, (2) manual annotation of errors, and (3) the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique. As an application of our approach, we analyze the transferability of a multilingual BERT (mBERT) model fine-tuned with annotated manifestos and media texts from five Indo-European language-speaking countries of the Comparative Agendas Project. The transferability is then evaluated using natural and synthetic parliamentary data from the UK, Basque, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

Gaining Consent to Survey Respondents’ Partners: The Importance of Anchors’ Survey Experience in Self-administered Modes,"{Dyadic surveys aim to interview pairs of respondents, such as partners in a relationship. In dyadic surveys, it is often necessary to obtain the anchors’ consent to contact their partners and invite them to a survey. If the survey is operated in self-administered modes, no interviewer is present to improve the consent rate, for example, by providing convincing arguments and additional information. To overcome the challenges posed by self-administered modes for dyadic surveys and to improve consent rates, it is important to identify aspects that positively influence the likelihood of anchors giving consent to contact their partners. Ideally, these aspects are in the hands of the researchers, such as the survey design and aspects of the questionnaire. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between anchors’ survey experience and their willingness to consent to surveying their partners in self-administered modes. Based on data from the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA), we found that the anchors’ perceptions of the questionnaire as “interesting” or “too personal” were related to consent rates.

Harmonizing data from open-ended and closed-ended quantity questions with observed score equating,"{Many surveys ask respondents about manifest quantities, such as income, age, weight, or their height. Surveys often either use open-ended questions, where respondents report the quantity directly as an integer value (e.g., “56”), or closed-ended quantity questions where respondents select from a set of discrete interval response options (e.g., “51 to 100”). Quantity data gathered with different response schemes thus becomes hard to compare or to harmonize to be used in integrative analyses. We compare two approaches to harmonizing quantity question data. Firstly, the widely used middle of category (MOC) interpolation. Secondly, Observed Score Equating in a Random Groups Design (OSE-RG). OSE-RG is originally an approach to harmonize measures for latent constructs. However, the equipercentile OSE-RG algorithm lends itself well to quantity questions. To test the performance of both algorithms, we gathered experimental data (N = 3484) on the number of books possessed as an example quantity, where we varied the quantity-question response scheme. We show that OSE-RG often outperforms or at least matches MOC when harmonizing closed-ended questions towards an open-ended format, or when harmonizing different closed-ended response formats amongst each other.

Digitalisation as a Prospect for Work–Life Balance and Inclusion: A Natural Experiment in German Hospitals,"{Digitalisation has a wide range of impacts on the workplace, such as enabling new work models with flexible work sched-ules, changing work content, or increasing workplace control.

Pressured by government, economic concerns, and medical innovation, this sector is undergoing a transformation process that is expediting the introduction of new networked digital technologies. Thus, it provides an ideal setting for empirical investigation, as one core assumption about digitalisation is that technological innovation at work has societal consequences that must be individually mastered.

The results confirm previous findings regarding the motivations of online panelists but also show important differences between professional and non-professional respondents. Specifically, the main participation reasons of professionals are topic interest (intrinsic) and incentives (extrinsic), while non-professionals are primarily motivated by intrinsic reasons (topic interest and purpose of study). This notion is also supported by the Latent Class Analyses, which showed that three of the four classes for professional respondents had a high probability of naming incentives as one of their main reasons for survey participation, whereas none of the four non-professional clusters rated incentives highly.

Using Eye-Tracking Methodology to Study Grid Question Designs in Web Surveys,"{Grid questions are frequently employed in web surveys due to their assumed response efficiency. In line with this, many previous studies have found shorter response times for grid questions compared to item-by-item formats. Our contribution to this literature is to investigate how altering the question format affects response behavior and the depth of cognitive processing when answering both grid question and item-by-item formats. To answer these questions, we implemented an experiment with three questions in an eye-tracking study. Each question consisted of a set of ten items which respondents answered either on a single page (large grid), on two pages with five items each (small grid), or on ten separate pages (item-by-item).

Did exposure to asylum seeking migration affect the electoral outcome of the ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ in Berlin? Evidence from the 2019 European elections,"{This article analyses the impact of exposure to asylum-seeking migration during the European ‘refugee crisis’ on votes for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland at the 2019 European elections in Berlin. While other scholars investigated the relationship between locals’ exposure to asylum-seekers and far-right voting, we analyse this relationship at a very small scale (electoral district level), adopting an innovative methodological approach, based on geo-localization techniques and high-resolution spatial statistics. Furthermore, we assess the impact on this relationship of some previously neglected variables. Through spatial regression models, we show that exposure to asylum-seeking migration is negatively correlated with AfD vote shares, which provides support for so-called ‘contact theory’ and that the relationship is stronger in better-off districts. Remarkably, the relationship is weaker in districts containing bigger reception centres, which suggests that the effects of asylum-seeking migration depend on the perceived contact intensity (and, therefore, a moderating effect of reception centre size). Finally, the effects of districts’ socio-economic deprivation on the relationship between exposure to asylum-seeking migration and AfD vote shares is different in districts located in former East and West Berlin, which suggests an effect of socio-cultural history on the relationship between exposure to migration and far-right voting.}",2023,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,"{european_elections,exposure_to_refugee_centres,far_right,germany,high-resolution_spatial_ statistics}",Arts and Humanities (miscellaneous),Arts and Humanities,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2023,"did exposure to asylum seeking migration affect the electoral outcome of the ‘alternative für deutschland’ in berlin? evidence from the 2019 european elections {this article analyses the impact of exposure to asylum-seeking migration during the european ‘refugee crisis’ on votes for the far-right alternative für deutschland at the 2019 european elections in berlin. while other scholars investigated the relationship between locals’ exposure to asylum-seekers and far-right voting, we analyse this relationship at a very small scale (electoral district level), adopting an innovative methodological approach, based on geo-localization techniques and high-resolution spatial statistics. furthermore, we assess the impact on this relationship of some previously neglected variables. through spatial regression models, we show that exposure to asylum-seeking migration is negatively correlated with afd vote shares, which provides support for so-called ‘contact theory’ and that the relationship is stronger in better-off districts. remarkably, the relationship is weaker in districts containing bigger reception centres, which suggests that the effects of asylum-seeking migration depend on the perceived contact intensity (and, therefore, a moderating effect of reception centre size). finally, the effects of districts’ socio-economic deprivation on the relationship between exposure to asylum-seeking migration and afd vote shares is different in districts located in former east and west berlin, which suggests an effect of socio-cultural history on the relationship between exposure to migration and far-right voting.} {european_elections,exposure_to_refugee_centres,far_right,germany,high-resolution_spatial_ statistics} {european_elections,exposure_to_refugee_centres,far_right,germany,high-resolution_spatial_ statistics}",0,0.43883799573268506,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election"

HOW DOES BACK TRANSLATION FARE AGAINST TEAM TRANSLATION? AN EXPERIMENTAL CASE STUDY IN THE LANGUAGE COMBINATION ENGLISH–GERMAN,"{When it comes to quality in questionnaire translation and hence comparability in comparative research, the chosen translation method is crucial for the outcome. Few empirical studies compare different translation methods—a fact which is often deplored in the research community. To fill the gap, in this study, the team translation approach is compared against a simple back-translation approach. The starting point in both cases was the initial English–German translations of ISSP (International Social Survey Program) questions. The final translations from both approaches were assessed, with a focus on how translation issues, such as mistranslations or wording issues identified in the initial translations were addressed. While none of the twenty-nine issues in the initial translation were present in the final team translation version, twenty-two of these issues were still present in the final version after the back-translation approach. For a selected number of items, we also ran a split-ballot experiment in a web survey. Only five out of fifteen items (33 percent) that went into the experiment showed significant differences between the translations, and only one could clearly be attributed to remaining errors in the back-translation version. In sum, the final translation from the team approach clearly outperformed the final translation from the back-translation approach when it comes to text-based criteria (in particular, accuracy and fluency). The quantitative test showed that many translation issues (those remaining in the translation after the back translation step) had no effect on the estimates. Nevertheless, we ask respondents to put effort into survey responding; in the same vein, we as researchers should put effort in the survey experience by providing questions that are clearly worded and free of errors, which puts the team approach ahead of the back-translation approach.}",2023,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{back translation,comparison of translation methods,questionnaire translation,split-ballot experiment,team translation}",Social Sciences (miscellaneous),Social Sciences,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2023,"how does back translation fare against team translation? an experimental case study in the language combination english–german {when it comes to quality in questionnaire translation and hence comparability in comparative research, the chosen translation method is crucial for the outcome. few empirical studies compare different translation methods—a fact which is often deplored in the research community. to fill the gap, in this study, the team translation approach is compared against a simple back-translation approach. the starting point in both cases was the initial english–german translations of issp (international social survey program) questions. the final translations from both approaches were assessed, with a focus on how translation issues, such as mistranslations or wording issues identified in the initial translations were addressed. while none of the twenty-nine issues in the initial translation were present in the final team translation version, twenty-two of these issues were still present in the final version after the back-translation approach. for a selected number of items, we also ran a split-ballot experiment in a web survey. only five out of fifteen items (33 percent) that went into the experiment showed significant differences between the translations, and only one could clearly be attributed to remaining errors in the back-translation version. in sum, the final translation from the team approach clearly outperformed the final translation from the back-translation approach when it comes to text-based criteria (in particular, accuracy and fluency). the quantitative test showed that many translation issues (those remaining in the translation after the back translation step) had no effect on the estimates. nevertheless, we ask respondents to put effort into survey responding; in the same vein, we as researchers should put effort in the survey experience by providing questions that are clearly worded and free of errors, which puts the team approach ahead of the back-translation approach.} {back translation,comparison of translation methods,questionnaire translation,split-ballot experiment,team translation} {back translation,comparison of translation methods,questionnaire translation,split-ballot experiment,team translation}",17,0.959926371374695,"split, questionnaire, errors, machine, languages"

How Do Internet-Related Characteristics Affect Whether Members of a German Mixed-Mode Panel Switch from the Mail to the Web Mode?,"{In recent years, several longitudinal studies have transitioned from an interviewer-administered to a mixed-mode design, using the internet as one of the modes of data collection. However, a substantial proportion of panelists are reluctant to participate in web surveys when offered a choice in an ongoing mixed-mode panel. We still know little about the characteristics of panel members that drive them to comply with the request to complete surveys via the internet. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating how internet-related characteristics are linked to the willingness of panelists to switch from the mail mode to the web. We use data from multiple waves of the GESIS Panel, a probability-based mixed-mode panel in Germany (N = 5734). A web-push intervention motivated 28% of 1364 panelists of the mail mode to complete the survey online in a single wave and 70% of these 380 short-term switchers to switch to the web mode permanently. We measured indicators of internet use, internet skills, and attitudes toward the internet as potential mechanisms of this short-term and long-term mode switching in the two waves before the intervention. Our results suggest that internet use and internet skills affect respondents’ willingness to switch modes in a single wave.

Children and youth at risk in times of transition: International and interdisciplinary perspectives,"{Children and youth belong to one of the most vulnerable groups in societies. This was the case even before the current humanitarian crises around the world which led millions of people and families to flee from wars, terror, poverty and exploitation.

Multi-label classification of open-ended questions with BERT,"{Open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. However, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. Traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. In the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. Most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. However, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. This paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. Here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. We evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the German language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES Panel (N=17,584, 55 labels). We evaluate the algorithms on 0/1 loss. We find that classification with BERT (forcing at least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered (18.9%-21.6%). Our work has important implications for social scientists: 1) Multi-label classification with BERT works in the German language for open-ends. 2) For mildly multi-label classification tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic classification. Previously, the loss was more substantial, usually requiring semiautomatic approaches. 3) Unlike the nearest competitor, ECC, multi-label classification with BERT requires only a single model for all labels.}",2023,"2023 Big Data Meets Survey Science, BigSurv 2023","{all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology}",Computer Science Applications,Computer Science,Physical Sciences,SS,2023,"multi-label classification of open-ended questions with bert {open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. however, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. in the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. however, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. this paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. we evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture bert for the german language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (binary relevance, label powerset, ecc) in a german social science survey, the gles panel (n=17,584, 55 labels). we evaluate the algorithms on 0/1 loss. we find that classification with bert (forcing at least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered (18.9%-21.6%). our work has important implications for social scientists: 1) multi-label classification with bert works in the german language for open-ends. 2) for mildly multi-label classification tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic classification. previously, the loss was more substantial, usually requiring semiautomatic approaches. 3) unlike the nearest competitor, ecc, multi-label classification with bert requires only a single model for all labels.} {all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology} {all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology}",15,1.0,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing"

A comprehensive analysis of acknowledgement texts in Web of Science: a case study on four scientific domains,"{Analysis of acknowledgments is particularly interesting as acknowledgments may give information not only about funding, but they are also able to reveal hidden contributions to authorship and the researcher’s collaboration patterns, context in which research was conducted, and specific aspects of the academic work. The focus of the present research is the analysis of a large sample of acknowledgement texts indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. Record types “article” and “review” from four different scientific domains, namely social sciences, economics, oceanography and computer science, published from 2014 to 2019 in a scientific journal in English were considered. Six types of acknowledged entities, i.e., funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation and miscellaneous, were extracted from the acknowledgement texts using a named entity recognition tagger and subsequently examined. A general analysis of the acknowledgement texts showed that indexing of funding information in WoS is incomplete. The analysis of the automatically extracted entities revealed differences and distinct patterns in the distribution of acknowledged entities of different types between different scientific domains. A strong association was found between acknowledged entity and scientific domain, and acknowledged entity and entity type.

The starting point in both cases was the initial English–German translations of ISSP (International Social Survey Program) questions. The final translations from both approaches were assessed, with a focus on how translation issues, such as mistranslations or wording issues identified in the initial translations were addressed. While none of the twenty-nine issues in the initial translation were present in the final team translation version, twenty-two of these issues were still present in the final version after the back-translation approach. For a selected number of items, we also ran a split-ballot experiment in a web survey.

Solidarity: A European Value?,"{Solidarity is considered essential for the sustainability of societies, both at the level of individual contributions to society and as an aspect of cooperation between countries. As such, solidarity is often called upon by politicians in a declarative way. In contrast to most prior work, we investigate an attitudinal perspective on solidarity, not behavioural or policy-preference perspectives. We look at questions such as the prevalence of solidarity attitudes among European populations, the degree to which the declared norm is shared among these populations, and whether solidarity attitudes have changed with consecutive crises in Europe. We also discuss possible antecedents of solidarity levels. Distinguishing solidarity by close and universal scopes, we find that both are associated with the identification of citizens with communities at different levels. In country and time comparisons, European societies display a good degree of homogeneity and stability. Close solidarity is more pronounced than universal solidarity, and this may have even increased over consecutive crises.

We find that students are well informed about earnings, on average, but substantially underestimate earnings in some occupations. Students from low socio-economic status (SES) families underestimate earnings more than those from high SES families, particularly earnings in high-status occupations. Therefore, low SES students expect smaller earning differences between high-income and low-income occupations than high-SES students. In turn, small expected differences between high-income and low-income occupations are associated with lower vocational aspirations as well as attainments.

We extend these findings by examining proxies of indeterminism belief in a cross-national dataset (N = 31 countries). We find that greater political and personal freedom is associated with higher tolerance for uncertainty, whereas religious belief, which posits a world determined by divine powers, is negatively associated with uncertainty tolerance.

The emergence of preprints: comparing publishing behaviour in the Global South and the Global North,"{Purpose: The recent proliferation of preprints could be a way for researchers worldwide to increase the availability and visibility of their research findings. Against the background of rising publication costs caused by the increasing prevalence of article processing fees, the search for other ways to publish research results besides traditional journal publication may increase.

Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, the authors are interested in the experiences and attitudes towards posting and using preprints in the Global South as opposed to the Global North. To explore whether motivations and concerns about posting preprints differ, the authors adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining a quantitative survey of researchers with focus group interviews.

The interplay of incentives and mode-choice design in self-administered mixed-mode surveys,"{Self-administered mixed-mode surveys are increasingly used as an alternative to face-to-face surveys for collecting data from the general population. However, little is known about how decisions regarding the incentive scheme and the mode-choice design jointly affect key outcomes such as response rates, net sample composition, and survey costs. To study this, we drew a probability sample of the residential population of the city of Mannheim, Germany (N = 2,980) and randomly assigned target persons to one of four incentive schemes (€0, €1, or €2 prepaid incentive on first contact, and €2 delayed prepaid incentive) and one of two mode-choice designs (concurrent or sequential [web-push]). Our results indicate that small prepaid monetary incentives work better in concurrent than in sequential designs. Moreover, a €2 prepaid incentive in a concurrent design proved particularly successful for older target persons, probably reinforcing their sense of trust and reciprocity, while also fitting better with their survey-mode preferences. Finally, a €2 delayed prepaid incentive in a sequential design primarily motivated target persons aged under 50 years. This combination of incentive scheme and mode-choice design also proved to be most cost-effective in that age group. Based on our results, we recommend using sampling frame information on age to address different age groups with different combinations of incentive scheme and mode-choice design.

The Division of Routine and Non-Routine Housework Among Migrant and Native Couples in Germany,"{Gender inequality in the division of household chores is a persistent issue over time and across country contexts, while differences within and between native and migrant couples remain largely unclear. Relying on the German country case, this study examines the association between partners’ migration constellations and the division of housework. We differentiate between natives and first-generation migrants, and within first-generation migrants, we differentiate by their regions of origin. For the division of housework, we analyse traditionally female routine tasks and male non-routine tasks. Following gender and resource explanations, this study expects gendered variation in the way native, migrant, and mixed (i.e., native/ migrant) couples divide housework. Utilising novel data from the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA-GGS sample, 2021), the paper employs OLS regression models to predict the division of housework among 11,223 cohabiting different-sex couples. The study finds a gender-traditional divide in routine household tasks among migrant couples, with heterogeneity across regions of origin. Specifically, women in Asian and Eastern European couples tend to do more routine tasks than their native counterparts, while the division of routine housework in couples from Western countries is more egalitarian.

Establishing standards for human-annotated samples applied in supervised machine learning - Evidence from a Monte Carlo simulation,"{Automated content analyses have become a popular tool in communication science.

We argue that a loss in prediction accuracy in supervised machine learning builds up over this two-stage procedure. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we tested (1) human coder errors (random, individual systematic, joint systematic) and (2) curation strategies for human-annotated datasets (one coder per document, majority rule, full agreement) as two sequential sources of accuracy loss of automated content analysis.

Solidarity: A European Value?,"{Solidarity is considered essential for the sustainability of societies, both at the level of individual contributions to society and as an aspect of cooperation between countries. As such, solidarity is often called upon by politicians in a declarative way. In contrast to most prior work, we investigate an attitudinal perspective on solidarity, not behavioural or policy-preference perspectives. We look at questions such as the prevalence of solidarity attitudes among European populations, the degree to which the declared norm is shared among these populations, and whether solidarity attitudes have changed with consecutive crises in Europe. We also discuss possible antecedents of solidarity levels. Distinguishing solidarity by close and universal scopes, we find that both are associated with the identification of citizens with communities at different levels. In country and time comparisons, European societies display a good degree of homogeneity and stability.

Thematic Introduction: Issue Saliency in the 2021 Federal Election,"{Germany is in a time of social upheaval. When the new ‘Traffic-Light’ coalition of SPD, Greens and FDP under the Social Democrat Olaf Scholz came to power, an era ended. The incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had been Chancellor for sixteen years, had decided not to stand for another term. The race for the chancellorship was on. While Merkel had long been accused of mainly avoiding substantive policy debates in Germany, the expectation of the 2021 federal election campaign was that it would be a fireworks display of substantive discussion. But that was only partly the case; instead the election was mainly about the candidates for Chancellor and their performance in the election campaign.

Multi-label classification of open-ended questions with BERT,"{Open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. However, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. Traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. In the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. Most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. However, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. This paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. Here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. We evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the German language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES Panel (N=17,584, 55 labels). We evaluate the algorithms on 0/1 loss. We find that classification with BERT (forcing at least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered (18.9%-21.6%). Our work has important implications for social scientists: 1) Multi-label classification with BERT works in the German language for open-ends. 2) For mildly multi-label classification tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic classification. Previously, the loss was more substantial, usually requiring semiautomatic approaches. 3) Unlike the nearest competitor, ECC, multi-label classification with BERT requires only a single model for all labels.}",2023,"2023 Big Data Meets Survey Science, BigSurv 2023","{all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology}",Artificial Intelligence,Computer Science,Physical Sciences,SS,2023,"multi-label classification of open-ended questions with bert {open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. however, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. in the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. however, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. this paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. we evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture bert for the german language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (binary relevance, label powerset, ecc) in a german social science survey, the gles panel (n=17,584, 55 labels). we evaluate the algorithms on 0/1 loss. we find that classification with bert (forcing at least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered (18.9%-21.6%). our work has important implications for social scientists: 1) multi-label classification with bert works in the german language for open-ends. 2) for mildly multi-label classification tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic classification. previously, the loss was more substantial, usually requiring semiautomatic approaches. 3) unlike the nearest competitor, ecc, multi-label classification with bert requires only a single model for all labels.} {all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology} {all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology}",15,0.6828552069239835,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing"

Intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: A question of gender and parenting style?,"{“Left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. But how do political ideological attitudes emerge? One central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. However, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. Nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the European context. This paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. Hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? How does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? These questions are examined using the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and Entrepreneurship (CUPESSE) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. First, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 European countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. Furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. The results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. It also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.}",2023,Frontiers in Political Science,"{intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",Political Science and International Relations,Social Sciences,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2023,"intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: a question of gender and parenting style? {“left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. but how do political ideological attitudes emerge? one central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. however, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the european context. this paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? how does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? these questions are examined using the cultural pathways to economic self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship (cupesse) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. first, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 european countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. the results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. it also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.} {intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth} {intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",-1,0.0022013447704315996,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe"
"Value orientation and external political efficacy: assessing the relationship between traditional values, progressive politics and political responsiveness","{Values are often used to explain phenomena associated with problematic political behaviours. For example, the election of far-right parties is often attributed to traditional values. The ‘Cultural Backlash’ thesis (Inglehart and Norris in Cultural backlash: trump, Brexit, and authoritarian populism. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2017a) is prominent in this field of research and explains such behaviour by a predominance of progressive issues as the result of Value Change. It is assumed that this causes traditional individuals to perceive the political system as less responsive, which can also be understood as low external political efficacy; however, there is little in the way of empirical research that tests the connection between one’s value orientation and one’s sense of external efficacy (Inglehart and Norris in Trump, Brexit, and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash, 2016; Inglehart and Norris in Cultural backlash: trump, Brexit, and authoritarian populism, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2017a; Inglehart and Norris in Perspect Polit 15(2):443-453, 2017b). This study aims to fill this gap by examining the effects of traditional values on perceptions of external efficacy, particular attention to the role of predominantly progressive politics. For this purpose, the relationship between values and external efficacy is brought into cross-national context in order to analyse the moderating effect of the degree of progressivity of the respective national political system. To test these assumption with multilevel mixed-effects model, this study uses European Social Survey data from 23 European countries and from the Manifesto Project.

This study asks in what way these structures affect the position taking and confrontation in speeches.

Bombed Cities: Legacies of Post‐War Planning on the Contemporary Urban and Social Fabric,"{Post‐Second World War reconstruction is an important field of research around the world, with strands of enquiry investigating architecture, urban archaeology, heritage studies, urban design, city planning, critical cartography, and social geog-raphy.

How Do Internet-Related Characteristics Affect Whether Members of a German Mixed-Mode Panel Switch from the Mail to the Web Mode?,"{In recent years, several longitudinal studies have transitioned from an interviewer-administered to a mixed-mode design, using the internet as one of the modes of data collection. However, a substantial proportion of panelists are reluctant to participate in web surveys when offered a choice in an ongoing mixed-mode panel. We still know little about the characteristics of panel members that drive them to comply with the request to complete surveys via the internet. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating how internet-related characteristics are linked to the willingness of panelists to switch from the mail mode to the web. We use data from multiple waves of the GESIS Panel, a probability-based mixed-mode panel in Germany (N = 5734). A web-push intervention motivated 28% of 1364 panelists of the mail mode to complete the survey online in a single wave and 70% of these 380 short-term switchers to switch to the web mode permanently. We measured indicators of internet use, internet skills, and attitudes toward the internet as potential mechanisms of this short-term and long-term mode switching in the two waves before the intervention. Our results suggest that internet use and internet skills affect respondents’ willingness to switch modes in a single wave. For these short-term switchers, however, none of the internet-related characteristics could explain mode switching in the long term.

Intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: A question of gender and parenting style?,"{“Left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. But how do political ideological attitudes emerge? One central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. However, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. Nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the European context. This paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. Hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? How does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? These questions are examined using the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and Entrepreneurship (CUPESSE) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. First, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 European countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. Furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. The results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. It also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.}",2023,Frontiers in Political Science,"{intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",Safety Research,Social Sciences,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2023,"intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: a question of gender and parenting style? {“left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. but how do political ideological attitudes emerge? one central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. however, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the european context. this paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? how does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? these questions are examined using the cultural pathways to economic self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship (cupesse) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. first, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 european countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. the results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. it also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.} {intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth} {intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",-1,0.0022013152309791374,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe"

Left behind in a public services wasteland? On the accessibility of public services and political trust,"{Public discourse and scholars alike argue that the spatial divide in voting behavior and attitudes is rooted in geographic inequalities that serve as breeding grounds for political discontent. In previous studies, scholars have mainly focused on the economic conditions to analyze how place-based context influences the voting behavior of citizens. However, this focus on voting behavior and a small set of contextual variables do not allow us to draw direct conclusions as to how, and which, place-based factors relate to discontent on the attitudinal level. I argue that the accessibility of public service infrastructure specifically serves as a low-intensity information cue for citizens to evaluate the political performance of modern welfare states. These evaluations complement objective economic perceptions and are part of the performance-trust link. Hence, citizens should trust the government less if public services are not provided or only hard to access. I test this relationship for the German case by spatially linking the addresses of survey respondents with the location of public service facilities and collective municipallevel data. The resulting unique data set allows to explore the relationship between the accessibility of public service facilities and political trust as well as their temporal development. Results of multilevel analyses indicate that shorter distances to train stations are associated with increased trust in the government, but all other results, such as the change in service provision, remain inconclusive.

Evaluating an Alternative Frame for Address-Based Sampling in Germany: The Address Database From Deutsche Post Direkt,"{In Germany, the population registers with addresses of individuals can be used for address-based sampling.

The present study tested the feasibility of using the address database from Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously conducted two almost identical surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of equal size (N = 3,000). One sample was drawn from the city’s population register, the other from the commercial ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD could be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules. However, these benefits come at considerable cost. First, the use of the ADB-DPD is limited to self-administered surveys. More importantly, in the net sample of the DPD survey, women and young persons were considerably underrepresented. This indicates coverage issues about which DPD provided no further information.

Using Google Trends Data to Learn More About Survey Participation,"{As response rates continue to decline, the need to learn more about the survey participation process remains an important task for survey researchers.

SimE4KG: Distributed and Explainable Multi-Modal Semantic Similarity Estimation for Knowledge Graphs,"{In recent years, exciting sources of data have been modeled as knowledge graphs (KGs). This modeling represents both structural relationships and the entity-specific multi-modal data in KGs. In various data analytics pipelines and machine learning (ML), the task of semantic similarity estimation plays a significant role. Assigning similarity values to entity pairs is needed in recommendation systems, clustering, classification, entity matching/disambiguation and many others. Efficient and scalable frameworks are needed to handle the quadratic complexity of all-pair semantic similarity on Big Data KGs. Moreover, heterogeneous KGs demand multi-modal semantic similarity estimation to cover the versatile contents like categorical relations between classes or their attribute literals like strings, timestamps or numeric data. In this paper, we propose the SimE4KG framework as a resource providing generic open-source modules that perform semantic similarity estimation in multi-modal KGs. To justify the computational costs of similarity estimation, the SimE4KG generates reproducible, reusable and explainable results. The pipeline results are a native semantic RDF KG, including the experiment results, hyper-parameter setup and explanation of the results, like the most influential features.

The emergence of preprints: comparing publishing behaviour in the Global South and the Global North,"{Purpose: The recent proliferation of preprints could be a way for researchers worldwide to increase the availability and visibility of their research findings. Against the background of rising publication costs caused by the increasing prevalence of article processing fees, the search for other ways to publish research results besides traditional journal publication may increase. This could be especially true for lower-income countries. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, the authors are interested in the experiences and attitudes towards posting and using preprints in the Global South as opposed to the Global North. To explore whether motivations and concerns about posting preprints differ, the authors adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining a quantitative survey of researchers with focus group interviews. Findings: The authors found that respondents from the Global South were more likely to agree to adhere to policies and to emphasise that mandates could change publishing behaviour towards open access. They were also more likely to agree posting preprints has a positive impact. Respondents from the Global South and the Global North emphasised the importance of peer-reviewed research for career advancement. Originality/value: The study has identified a wide range of experiences with and attitudes towards posting preprints among researchers in the Global South and the Global North. To the authors' knowledge, this has hardly been studied before, which is also because preprints only have emerged lately in many disciplines and countries.

Did exposure to asylum seeking migration affect the electoral outcome of the ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ in Berlin? Evidence from the 2019 European elections,"{This article analyses the impact of exposure to asylum-seeking migration during the European ‘refugee crisis’ on votes for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland at the 2019 European elections in Berlin. While other scholars investigated the relationship between locals’ exposure to asylum-seekers and far-right voting, we analyse this relationship at a very small scale (electoral district level), adopting an innovative methodological approach, based on geo-localization techniques and high-resolution spatial statistics. Furthermore, we assess the impact on this relationship of some previously neglected variables. Through spatial regression models, we show that exposure to asylum-seeking migration is negatively correlated with AfD vote shares, which provides support for so-called ‘contact theory’ and that the relationship is stronger in better-off districts. Remarkably, the relationship is weaker in districts containing bigger reception centres, which suggests that the effects of asylum-seeking migration depend on the perceived contact intensity (and, therefore, a moderating effect of reception centre size). Finally, the effects of districts’ socio-economic deprivation on the relationship between exposure to asylum-seeking migration and AfD vote shares is different in districts located in former East and West Berlin, which suggests an effect of socio-cultural history on the relationship between exposure to migration and far-right voting.}",2023,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,"{european_elections,exposure_to_refugee_centres,far_right,germany,high-resolution_spatial_ statistics}",Demography,Social Sciences,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2023,"did exposure to asylum seeking migration affect the electoral outcome of the ‘alternative für deutschland’ in berlin? evidence from the 2019 european elections {this article analyses the impact of exposure to asylum-seeking migration during the european ‘refugee crisis’ on votes for the far-right alternative für deutschland at the 2019 european elections in berlin. while other scholars investigated the relationship between locals’ exposure to asylum-seekers and far-right voting, we analyse this relationship at a very small scale (electoral district level), adopting an innovative methodological approach, based on geo-localization techniques and high-resolution spatial statistics. furthermore, we assess the impact on this relationship of some previously neglected variables. through spatial regression models, we show that exposure to asylum-seeking migration is negatively correlated with afd vote shares, which provides support for so-called ‘contact theory’ and that the relationship is stronger in better-off districts. remarkably, the relationship is weaker in districts containing bigger reception centres, which suggests that the effects of asylum-seeking migration depend on the perceived contact intensity (and, therefore, a moderating effect of reception centre size). finally, the effects of districts’ socio-economic deprivation on the relationship between exposure to asylum-seeking migration and afd vote shares is different in districts located in former east and west berlin, which suggests an effect of socio-cultural history on the relationship between exposure to migration and far-right voting.} {european_elections,exposure_to_refugee_centres,far_right,germany,high-resolution_spatial_ statistics} {european_elections,exposure_to_refugee_centres,far_right,germany,high-resolution_spatial_ statistics}",0,0.4493674062977276,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election"
Evaluating an Alternative Frame for Address-Based Sampling in Germany: The Address Database From Deutsche Post Direkt,"{In Germany, the population registers with addresses of individuals can be used for address-based sampling. However, unlike countries with a centralized register, municipalities in Germany administer their registers themselves. This not only makes sampling for a nationwide survey more costly and cumbersome but may also result in gaps in the gross sample, as selected municipalities may refuse to allow their registers to be used for sampling purposes. If substitute municipalities are not available, other sampling methods are required. The present study tested the feasibility of using the address database from Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously conducted two almost identical surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of equal size (N = 3,000). One sample was drawn from the city’s population register, the other from the commercial ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD could be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules. However, these benefits come at considerable cost. First, the use of the ADB-DPD is limited to self-administered surveys. More importantly, in the net sample of the DPD survey, women and young persons were considerably underrepresented. This indicates coverage issues about which DPD provided no further information.

Intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: A question of gender and parenting style?,"{“Left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. But how do political ideological attitudes emerge? One central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. However, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. Nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the European context. This paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. Hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? How does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? These questions are examined using the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and Entrepreneurship (CUPESSE) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. First, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 European countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. Furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. The results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. It also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.}",2023,Frontiers in Political Science,"{intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",Sociology and Political Science,Social Sciences,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2023,"intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: a question of gender and parenting style? {“left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. but how do political ideological attitudes emerge? one central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. however, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the european context. this paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? how does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? these questions are examined using the cultural pathways to economic self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship (cupesse) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. first, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 european countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. the results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. it also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.} {intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth} {intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",-1,0.0022012310841159747,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe"

How Do Internet-Related Characteristics Affect Whether Members of a German Mixed-Mode Panel Switch from the Mail to the Web Mode?,"{In recent years, several longitudinal studies have transitioned from an interviewer-administered to a mixed-mode design, using the internet as one of the modes of data collection. However, a substantial proportion of panelists are reluctant to participate in web surveys when offered a choice in an ongoing mixed-mode panel. We still know little about the characteristics of panel members that drive them to comply with the request to complete surveys via the internet. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating how internet-related characteristics are linked to the willingness of panelists to switch from the mail mode to the web. We use data from multiple waves of the GESIS Panel, a probability-based mixed-mode panel in Germany (N = 5734). A web-push intervention motivated 28% of 1364 panelists of the mail mode to complete the survey online in a single wave and 70% of these 380 short-term switchers to switch to the web mode permanently. We measured indicators of internet use, internet skills, and attitudes toward the internet as potential mechanisms of this short-term and long-term mode switching in the two waves before the intervention. Our results suggest that internet use and internet skills affect respondents’ willingness to switch modes in a single wave.

Evaluating an Alternative Frame for Address-Based Sampling in Germany: The Address Database From Deutsche Post Direkt,"{In Germany, the population registers with addresses of individuals can be used for address-based sampling. However, unlike countries with a centralized register, municipalities in Germany administer their registers themselves. This not only makes sampling for a nationwide survey more costly and cumbersome but may also result in gaps in the gross sample, as selected municipalities may refuse to allow their registers to be used for sampling purposes. If substitute municipalities are not available, other sampling methods are required. The present study tested the feasibility of using the address database from Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously conducted two almost identical surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of equal size (N = 3,000). One sample was drawn from the city’s population register, the other from the commercial ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD could be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules. However, these benefits come at considerable cost. First, the use of the ADB-DPD is limited to self-administered surveys. More importantly, in the net sample of the DPD survey, women and young persons were considerably underrepresented. This indicates coverage issues about which DPD provided no further information.

HOW DOES BACK TRANSLATION FARE AGAINST TEAM TRANSLATION? AN EXPERIMENTAL CASE STUDY IN THE LANGUAGE COMBINATION ENGLISH–GERMAN,"{When it comes to quality in questionnaire translation and hence comparability in comparative research, the chosen translation method is crucial for the outcome. Few empirical studies compare different translation methods—a fact which is often deplored in the research community. To fill the gap, in this study, the team translation approach is compared against a simple back-translation approach. The starting point in both cases was the initial English–German translations of ISSP (International Social Survey Program) questions. The final translations from both approaches were assessed, with a focus on how translation issues, such as mistranslations or wording issues identified in the initial translations were addressed. While none of the twenty-nine issues in the initial translation were present in the final team translation version, twenty-two of these issues were still present in the final version after the back-translation approach. For a selected number of items, we also ran a split-ballot experiment in a web survey. Only five out of fifteen items (33 percent) that went into the experiment showed significant differences between the translations, and only one could clearly be attributed to remaining errors in the back-translation version. In sum, the final translation from the team approach clearly outperformed the final translation from the back-translation approach when it comes to text-based criteria (in particular, accuracy and fluency). The quantitative test showed that many translation issues (those remaining in the translation after the back translation step) had no effect on the estimates.

The emergence of preprints: comparing publishing behaviour in the Global South and the Global North,"{Purpose: The recent proliferation of preprints could be a way for researchers worldwide to increase the availability and visibility of their research findings. Against the background of rising publication costs caused by the increasing prevalence of article processing fees, the search for other ways to publish research results besides traditional journal publication may increase. This could be especially true for lower-income countries. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, the authors are interested in the experiences and attitudes towards posting and using preprints in the Global South as opposed to the Global North. To explore whether motivations and concerns about posting preprints differ, the authors adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining a quantitative survey of researchers with focus group interviews. Findings: The authors found that respondents from the Global South were more likely to agree to adhere to policies and to emphasise that mandates could change publishing behaviour towards open access. They were also more likely to agree posting preprints has a positive impact. Respondents from the Global South and the Global North emphasised the importance of peer-reviewed research for career advancement.

Which factors are associated with Open Access publishing? A Springer Nature case study,"{Open Access (OA) facilitates access to research articles. However, authors or funders often must pay the publishing costs, preventing authors who do not receive financial support from participating in OA publishing and gaining citation advantage for OA articles.

A machine learning classification method helped us to explore the importance of different features in predicting the publishing model. The results show that authors eligible for article processing charge (APC) waivers publish more in gold OA journals than others. In contrast, authors eligible for an APC discount have the lowest ratio of OA publications, leading to the assumption that this discount insufficiently motivates authors to publish in gold OA journals.

An English-Language adaptation and validation of the Justice Sensitivity Short Scales–8 (JSS-8),"{The construct of justice sensitivity has four perspectives that capture individual differences in the strength of reactions to injustice when becoming a victim of injustice (victim sensitivity), when witnessing injustice as an outsider (observer sensitivity), when passively benefitting from an injustice done to others (beneficiary sensitivity), or when committing an injustice (perpetrator sensitivity).

INNOVATING WEB PROBING: COMPARING WRITTEN AND ORAL ANSWERS TO OPEN-ENDED PROBING QUESTIONS IN A SMARTPHONE SURVEY,"{Cognitive interviewing in the form of probing is key for developing methodologically sound survey questions. For a long time, probing was tied to the laboratory setting, making it difficult to achieve large sample sizes and creating a time-intensive undertaking for both researchers and participants.

In so-called web probing studies, respondents first answer a question and then they receive one or more open-ended questions about their response process, with requests for written answers. However, participants frequently provide very short or no answers at all to open-ended questions, in part because answering questions in writing is tedious.

Family structure and children’s (non-) diverging destinies in adulthood: A decomposition approach,"{Objective: This study investigates McLanahan's diverging destinies thesis by examining whether growing up in a one-parent family is associated with individual-and aggregate-level socioeconomic inequalities in adulthood among children from different social backgrounds. Background: One-parent families are consistently viewed as a driver of socioeconomic inequalities among children from different social backgrounds. However, the outcomes of children from different social backgrounds might be differentially affected by growing up in a one-parent family. This effect heterogeneity by social background might lead to the destinies of children from different social backgrounds converging rather than diverging. Method: Drawing on data from the German Family Panel – pairfam (Wave 6, 2013/2014), this study (1) investigated the prevalence of one-parent families by social background, (2) ran ordinary least squares regression models to examine the association between growing up in a one-parent family and children's socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood (ages 29–43), and (3) employed decomposition techniques to estimate the role of one-parent families in explaining aggregate-level socioeconomic inequalities in adulthood among children from different social backgrounds. Results: Results revealed that growing up in a one-parent family is negatively associated with children's socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood on the individual level, independent of social background.

Stamp—Standardized Data Management Plan for Educational Research: A Blueprint to Improve Data Management across Disciplines,"{To provide more tailored, discipline-specific guidance on data management, Science Europe suggested the concept of domain data protocols. Based on this concept, the project Domain Data Protocols for Educational Research developed a first domain data protocol for educational research, titled Standardized Data Management Plan for Educational Research (Stamp). Its multi-level approach includes minimal conditions on managing data according to the FAIR Data Principles and checklists with concrete activities to reach each minimal condition; also included are auxiliary materials to support researchers in educational research in planning, implementing, and realizing different data management activities. Although we developed the Stamp for educational research, its design and flexible structure enables transferring it to other (research) domains and communities.

Facebook as an Avenue to News: A Comparison and Validation of Approaches to Identify Facebook Referrals,"{Given that Facebook is still the most widely used social networking site in the world, its influence on democratic processes is under constant scrutiny.

Toeing the Party Line: Election Manifestos as a Key to Understand Political Discourse on Twitter,"{Political discourse on Twitter is a moving target: politicians continuously make statements about their positions. It is therefore crucial to track their discourse on social media to understand their ideological positions and goals. However, Twitter data is also challenging to work with since it is ambiguous and often dependent on social context, and consequently, recent work on political positioning has tended to focus strongly on manifestos (parties' electoral programs) rather than social media. In this paper, we extend recently proposed methods to predict pairwise positional similarities between parties from the manifesto case to the Twitter case, using hashtags as a signal to fine-tune text representations, without the need for manual annotation. We verify the efficacy of fine-tuning and conduct a series of experiments that assess the robustness of our method for low-resource scenarios. We find that our method yields stable positioning reflective of manifesto positioning, both in scenarios with all tweets of candidates across years available and when only smaller subsets from shorter time periods are available.

What Did I Say Again?

In conversational commerce, these assistants help customers find suitable products in online shops through natural language conversations.

While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052 % were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns.

Automatic Analysis of Political Debates and Manifestos: Successes and Challenges,"{The opinions of political actors (e.g., politicians, parties, organizations) expressed through claims are the core elements of political debates and decision-making. Political actors communicate through different channels: parties publish manifestos for major elections, while individual actors make statements on a day-to-day basis as reflected in the media. These two channels offer different approaches for analysis: Manifestos, on the one hand, are useful to characterize the parties’ positions at a global ideological level over time. In contrast, individual statements can be collected to analyze debates in particular policy domains on a fine-grained level, in terms of individual actors and claims. In this article, we summarize a series of studies we have carried out. We apply NLP-driven (semi-)automatic analyses on these two channels and compare their potentials and challenges. The fine-grained analysis yields rich insights into the communication but comes at the cost of three challenges: (a) a substantial hunger for manual annotation, introducing practical hurdles for analysis both within and across languages; (b) difficulties in claim classification arising from the uneven frequency distribution over the theory-based annotation schemas; (c) the need to map actor mentions onto canonical versions. Manifesto-based analysis avoids these challenges to a substantial extent when a more coarse-grained analysis of party positions is sufficient. We highlight the benefits and challenges of both approaches, and conclude by outlining perspectives for addressing the challenges in future research.}",2024,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"{argument mining,claim identification,discourse network analysis,party positioning}",Theoretical Computer Science,Mathematics,Physical Sciences,SS,2024,"automatic analysis of political debates and manifestos: successes and challenges {the opinions of political actors (e.g., politicians, parties, organizations) expressed through claims are the core elements of political debates and decision-making. political actors communicate through different channels: parties publish manifestos for major elections, while individual actors make statements on a day-to-day basis as reflected in the media. these two channels offer different approaches for analysis: manifestos, on the one hand, are useful to characterize the parties’ positions at a global ideological level over time. in contrast, individual statements can be collected to analyze debates in particular policy domains on a fine-grained level, in terms of individual actors and claims. in this article, we summarize a series of studies we have carried out. we apply nlp-driven (semi-)automatic analyses on these two channels and compare their potentials and challenges. the fine-grained analysis yields rich insights into the communication but comes at the cost of three challenges: (a) a substantial hunger for manual annotation, introducing practical hurdles for analysis both within and across languages; (b) difficulties in claim classification arising from the uneven frequency distribution over the theory-based annotation schemas; (c) the need to map actor mentions onto canonical versions. manifesto-based analysis avoids these challenges to a substantial extent when a more coarse-grained analysis of party positions is sufficient. we highlight the benefits and challenges of both approaches, and conclude by outlining perspectives for addressing the challenges in future research.} {argument mining,claim identification,discourse network analysis,party positioning} {argument mining,claim identification,discourse network analysis,party positioning}",26,1.0,"discourse, social media, polarization, scenarios, election"

However, using open-ended probing questions we delved deeper into the effects of different translation versions.

The ethnic penalty in welfare deservingness: A factorial survey experiment on welfare chauvinism in pension attitudes in Germany,"{This study investigates whether pensioners with a foreign ethnic background are perceived as less deserving to receive a pension than are native pensioners. It focuses on Germany as an example with a strongly achievement-oriented social insurance system which closely links benefits to previous contributions. Hence, the system prevents a citizen from receiving benefits without having contributed. Our study thus adds to existing research by examining a less likely case to find welfare chauvinistic attitudes. To test our expectations, we rely on a factorial survey design and a probability sample of the German population in 2019. Survey respondents decide on the amount of pension benefits that a hypothetical pensioner should receive. Characteristics of the hypothetical pensioner – ethnic background, gender, last income, contribution years, the number of children and other dependents – are randomly varied. Our study finds support for welfare chauvinist attitudes in an achievement-oriented social insurance system. Even for the same achievement, that is, same income, contribution years and number of children, natives grant lower pensions to pensioners with a foreign ethnic background than to natives.

"Unravelling the relationship between employment, social transfers and income poverty: Policy and measurement","{Despite the rise in employment, consistently high EU-average poverty rates continue to generate debates about the factors that explain the level and changes in the relative poverty rate, both within and across countries. Assuming a strong negative correlation between poverty and employment, the article investigates the role of four mechanisms responsible for this blurred relationship. Using decomposition analysis and macro-level regression analysis, we investigate the extent to which (i) the distribution of employment across households with different levels of work intensity, (ii) the expansion of non-standard work, (iii) the change in the effectiveness of social welfare systems, and (iv) the change in median income and the corresponding shift in the poverty threshold have contributed to changes in relative income poverty in the last decades. We found that employment growth benefits poverty reduction, but this positive effect was partially offset by the precarious characteristics of some newly created jobs. If the distribution of jobs had favoured the jobless more in the pre-crisis period, the relative income poverty rate would have been lower. Although the share of persons in jobless households decreased during the recovery years, their risk of poverty increased due to the retrenchment of social transfers during and after the Great Recession. Furthermore, the use of a floating threshold, which is linked to changes in median income, underestimates the strength of the relationships between poverty, employment and social transfers: when the poverty threshold is kept fixed, not only do the dynamics of poverty look different, but the estimated coefficients are considerably larger.}",2024,Journal of European Social Policy,"{employment,european union,fixed-effects panel regression,median income,relative income poverty,social transfers}",Social Sciences (all),,,SS,2024,"unravelling the relationship between employment, social transfers and income poverty: policy and measurement {despite the rise in employment, consistently high eu-average poverty rates continue to generate debates about the factors that explain the level and changes in the relative poverty rate, both within and across countries. assuming a strong negative correlation between poverty and employment, the article investigates the role of four mechanisms responsible for this blurred relationship. using decomposition analysis and macro-level regression analysis, we investigate the extent to which (i) the distribution of employment across households with different levels of work intensity, (ii) the expansion of non-standard work, (iii) the change in the effectiveness of social welfare systems, and (iv) the change in median income and the corresponding shift in the poverty threshold have contributed to changes in relative income poverty in the last decades. we found that employment growth benefits poverty reduction, but this positive effect was partially offset by the precarious characteristics of some newly created jobs. if the distribution of jobs had favoured the jobless more in the pre-crisis period, the relative income poverty rate would have been lower. although the share of persons in jobless households decreased during the recovery years, their risk of poverty increased due to the retrenchment of social transfers during and after the great recession. furthermore, the use of a floating threshold, which is linked to changes in median income, underestimates the strength of the relationships between poverty, employment and social transfers: when the poverty threshold is kept fixed, not only do the dynamics of poverty look different, but the estimated coefficients are considerably larger.} {employment,european union,fixed-effects panel regression,median income,relative income poverty,social transfers} {employment,european union,fixed-effects panel regression,median income,relative income poverty,social transfers}",0,1.0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election"

SEQUENTIAL AND CONCURRENT MIXED-MODE DESIGNS: A TAILORED APPROACH,"{Due to rising costs and declining response rates, surveys are increasingly moving from face-to-face interviewing to a self-administered mixed-mode design. Mixed-mode surveys can be conducted using a concurrent or a sequential design. A sequential design in which the web mode is offered first is a common strategy for mixed-mode surveys as it reduces survey costs. However, when deciding which mode choice sequence to use, sample balance should also be considered. One approach to achieving a balanced sample might be to tailor the sequence of the choice of modes, or the mode choice sequence. For this purpose, we use an indicator that assigns the sampled persons to the different mode choice sequences to minimize the variability of response probabilities. In this study, we compare the sample composition achieved with a concurrent and a sequential design. Additionally, we investigate whether indicator-based tailoring of the two mode choice sequences can improve sample composition. We implemented a randomized experiment in the 2021 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), which surveyed the general population aged 18 and older in private households (N 5,342) using a mixed-mode design (web and mail). In a first step, respondents were randomly assigned to a concurrent or a sequential design. We find that the two mode choice sequences lead to a similar sample composition.

"Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic","{Introduction: This research examines the effect of individual differences in the need for cognitive closure and political trust on the endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We hypothesize that individuals high in cognitive closure and low in political trust will seize on conspiracy accounts of the pandemic.

Method: To test our preregistered hypotheses, we rely on data from multiple waves of a representative survey among the German population (N = 2,883). The need for cognitive closure and general political trust was assessed before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, while belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and specific trust in handling the crisis was fielded during the second wave of the pandemic. Results: We find that individuals with a high need for cognitive closure are more likely to accept conspiracy narratives, but the effect size is small. At the same time, pre-pandemic trust and concurrent trust in political and medical institutions are strongly negatively related to conspiracy beliefs. We find no support for a moderating effect of political trust.

However, there is little guidance as to when to offer which mode, especially when the aim is to recruit participants for a panel survey. This study examines the effectiveness of different mode-sequence designs by analyzing an experiment implemented in the recruitment wave of the German panel study ""Family Research and Demographic Analysis.""We randomly assigned 108,256 individuals aged 18-49 years to one of three mode-sequence-design conditions: concurrent, web-first including a paper-based questionnaire with the second reminder (web-first-2), and web-first including a paper-based questionnaire with the third reminder (web-first-3). A fourth, simulated group did not receive a paper-based questionnaire (web-only).

Does temporary employment increase length of commuting? Longitudinal evidence from Australia and Germany,"{On average, temporary jobs are far less stable than permanent jobs.

"Putting authoritarianism in context: A multilevel analysis of regional effects on individual expressions of right-wing authoritarianism, conspiracy mentality, and superstition","{Ever since its original conception, authoritarianism is claimed to be the driving force behind various forms of anti-modern attitudes and politics. While current research mainly focuses on three dimensions of right-wing authoritarianism, namely authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, and conventionalism, the original F-scale was more extensive, including conspiracy mentality and superstition among others.

Our analyses reveal that significant regional differences, which go beyond mere East-West differences in authoritarian attitudes in Germany, can partly be explained by the selected context variables.

Fixed is not the opposite of growth: Item keying matters for measuring mindsets,"{Research on growth mindset, the belief that one’s cognitive abilities are malleable and can be developed through dedication and practice, has received considerable media attention and influenced educational policy and practice. However, mindset theory and measurement have also drawn criticism. In the present paper, we add a cautionary note pertaining to the conceptualization and measurement of growth mindset. Through a critical reanalysis of a large-scale representative study of adolescents from the US (N = 15,362), we show that a growth (i.e., forward-keyed) and a fixed (i.e., reverse keyed) mindset item from a widely used scale are only moderately correlated (r = −.31). Further, we demonstrate that the two items are very differently related with a range of educationally relevant criteria such as learning engagement and self-efficacy, and sociodemographic characteristics such as sex. This leads us to conclude that the growth and fixed mindset items are not mutually interchangeable (apart from keying) indicators of a unidimensional construct that has fixed and growth mindset at its opposing poles.

Is there a geography of Euroscepticism among the winners and losers of globalization?,"{Support for EU membership has long been an important topic of study. Individual-level research shows that winners of globalisation, including the higher educated, express greater EU support as they profit from economic and cultural conditions resulting from European integration. Recent context-focused work suggests that individuals in ‘left-behind’ places are less supportive of EU integration because of their home regions’ weaker long-term economic conditions. This paper brings these two research strands into conversation with each other by examining how the relationship between EU support and individual-level education is contingent on subnational economic conditions. Using harmonised Eurobarometer data from almost 750,000 respondents spanning 2004–2019, combined with subnational economic data from 201 European regions, we find no evidence that subnational economic conditions influence the relationship between EU support and respondents’ education level. At the same time, when cross-sectionally comparing long-term differences between regions, we find that EU support is positively related to regional GDP per capita (though unrelated to regional unemployment), among both the higher and lower educated, and especially in the post-Great Recession period.

Supporting Data Discovery: Comparing Perspectives of Support Specialists and Researchers,"{Purpose: Much of the research in data discovery is centered on the users’ viewpoint, frequently overlooking the perspective of those who develop and maintain the discovery infrastructure. Our goal is to conduct a comparative study on research data discovery, examining both support specialists’ and researchers’ views by merging new analysis with prior research insights. Methods: This work summarizes the studies the authors have conducted over the last seven years investigating the data discovery practices of support specialists from different disciplines. Although support specialists were not the main target of some of these studies, data about their perspectives was collected. Our corpus comprises in-depth interviews with 6 social science support specialists, interviews with 19 researchers and 3 support specialists from multiple disciplines, a global survey with 1630 researchers and 47 support specialists, and a use case analysis of 25 support specialists. In the analysis section, we juxtapose the fresh insights on support specialists’ views with the already documented perspectives of researchers for a holistic understanding. The latter is primarily discussed in the literature review, with references made in the analysis section to draw comparisons.

Antisemitism in East and W est Germany: Three decades after the wall: a comparative longitudinal study considering age-period-cohort effects,"{Since the unification of the two German states in 1990, antisemitic attitudes have been repeatedly polled in cross-sectional or longitudinal national surveys (e.g., the long-term GFE surveys). So far, comparative studies analyzing the development of antisemitism in East and West Germany over a longer time period are scarce. The study covers a time span of 30 years to investigate two forms of antisemitism (classical and secondary), especially with respect to inner-German differences. Applying model-based age-period-cohort analyses (APC) with a total of 19 available representative surveys (maximal period: 1991-2021), theory-driven hypotheses are tested. The statistical approach and respective findings are discussed with emphasis on several challenges accompanying the utilized heterogenous data and different survey modes. Findings reveal that life-cycle effects play a decisive role in the attitudinal development and distribution of antisemitic attitudes. Moreover, approval of antisemitism is to some extent cohort related in both East and West Germany, while disentangling period effects empirically poses challenges due to data limitations. Furthermore, the observed APC structures differ for classical and secondary antisemitism.

Measuring Global Character Dimensions: An Ant Colony Optimization Approach toward Three Core Strength Scales,"{The Values in Action (VIA) framework encompasses 24 universally valued character strengths.

In the present study, we selected 18 items to measure the three metatraits from the 96-item IPIP-VIA-R inventory. To optimize the item selection while considering multiple psychometric criteria simultaneously, we made use of Ant Colony Optimization.

SEQUENTIAL AND CONCURRENT MIXED-MODE DESIGNS: A TAILORED APPROACH,"{Due to rising costs and declining response rates, surveys are increasingly moving from face-to-face interviewing to a self-administered mixed-mode design. Mixed-mode surveys can be conducted using a concurrent or a sequential design. A sequential design in which the web mode is offered first is a common strategy for mixed-mode surveys as it reduces survey costs. However, when deciding which mode choice sequence to use, sample balance should also be considered. One approach to achieving a balanced sample might be to tailor the sequence of the choice of modes, or the mode choice sequence. For this purpose, we use an indicator that assigns the sampled persons to the different mode choice sequences to minimize the variability of response probabilities. In this study, we compare the sample composition achieved with a concurrent and a sequential design. Additionally, we investigate whether indicator-based tailoring of the two mode choice sequences can improve sample composition. We implemented a randomized experiment in the 2021 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), which surveyed the general population aged 18 and older in private households (N 5,342) using a mixed-mode design (web and mail). In a first step, respondents were randomly assigned to a concurrent or a sequential design. We find that the two mode choice sequences lead to a similar sample composition.

Why we need to abandon fixed cutoffs for goodness-of-fit indices: An extensive simulation and possible solutions,"{To evaluate model fit in confirmatory factor analysis, researchers compare goodness-of-fit indices (GOFs) against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI >.950) derived from simulation studies. Methodologists have cautioned that cutoffs for GOFs are only valid for settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which cutoffs originated. Despite these warnings, fixed cutoffs for popular GOFs (i.e., χ2, χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) continue to be widely used in applied research. We (1) argue that the practice of using fixed cutoffs needs to be abandoned and (2) review time-honored and emerging alternatives to fixed cutoffs. We first present the most in-depth simulation study to date on the sensitivity of GOFs to model misspecification (i.e., misspecified factor dimensionality and unmodeled cross-loadings) and their susceptibility to further data and analysis characteristics (i.e., estimator, number of indicators, number and distribution of response options, loading magnitude, sample size, and factor correlation). We included all characteristics identified as influential in previous studies. Our simulation enabled us to replicate well-known influences on GOFs and establish hitherto unknown or underappreciated ones. In particular, the magnitude of the factor correlation turned out to moderate the effects of several characteristics on GOFs. Second, to address these problems, we discuss several strategies for assessing model fit that take the dependency of GOFs on the modeling context into account. We highlight tailored (or “dynamic”) cutoffs as a way forward.

Early Childhood Care in the Former East Germany and Mental Stress in Adulthood,"{Background: It is still debated in Germany whether early childhood care outside the family might cause mental stress in adulthood. In the German Democratic Republic (GDR—the former East Germany before unification), children were often cared for outside the family from a very early age. Methods: To determine the relation between early childhood care outside the family and mental stress in adulthood, we carried out a survey among 1575 persons who were born and socialized in the GDR. They were classified into four care groups according to the age at which they were first cared for outside the family.

Asking for Traces: A Vignette Study on Acceptability Norms and Personal Willingness to Donate Digital Trace Data,"{Digital trace data are increasingly used in the social sciences.

Men benefit from performing more complex and autonomous tasks, with additional gains when an inter-segmental job change accompanies the increase in complex job tasks.

Do social engagement skills exist and matter beyond personality facet traits and vocational interests? A generalization study across six countries,"{Social engagement skills as capacities for active interpersonal engagement are thought to conceptually differ from behavioral and motivational tendencies and to predict learning and life outcomes. We tested these assumptions on the distinct nature and relevance of social engagement skills. Quota-representative self-reports from 6987 adults in six countries showed strong relations of social engagement skills with personality facets and weaker with vocational interests. Partially supporting their distinctiveness, social engagement skills were not fully reducible to those correlates. Skills predicted self-reported learning, quality-of-life, and job outcomes, but offered little incremental validity beyond personality and interests. Results largely generalized across countries. Yet, the complex interplay between social engagement skills, individual differences, and outcomes demonstrated cross-country variations, suggesting sensitivity to sociocontextual factors. We conclude that while social engagement skills conceptually differ from personality and interests and in themselves predict life success, they add limited empirical value beyond these constructs, at least for self-reports. Educational relevance statement: Social engagement skills are the capacities to actively engage with others. It is thought that these capacities differ from other person characteristics (e.g., behavioral or motivational tendencies), and that this distinction matters for explaining life success. Our study showed that while self-reported social engagement skills shared similarities with other person characteristics, they still had unique aspects. Moreover, social engagement skills mattered, such that more skilled adults reported higher quality-of-life, but not necessarily better learning. However, social engagement skills did not provide much extra insight into life success beyond what was already known from other person characteristics. Other than the remaining results, these complex relations between social engagement skills, person characteristics, and life success largely varied across countries. The results highlight the importance of assessing social skills in a situation-specific manner, which will be imperative for targeted educational practices in the future.

"Socio-emotional experiences of primary school students: Relations to teachers’ underestimation, overestimation, or accurate judgment of their cognitive ability","{Previous research revealed that students who are overestimated in their ability by their teachers experience school more positively than underestimated students. In the present study, we compared the socio-emotional experiences of N = 1516 students whose cognitive abilities were overestimated, accurately judged, or underestimated by their teachers. We applied propensity score matching using students’ cognitive ability, gender, language, parental education, and teacher’s acquaintance with them as covariates for building the three student groups. Matching students on these variables, reduced the original sample size to subsamples with n1 = 348, and n2 = 312 with exact matching including classroom. We compared overestimated, accurately judged, or underestimated students in both matching samples in their socio-emotional profiles (comprised of academic self-concept, joy of learning, attitude towards school, willingness to make an effort, social integration, perceived class climate, and feeling of being accepted by the teacher) by linear discriminant analyses.

Embedding models for supervised automatic extraction and classification of named entities in scientific acknowledgements,"{Acknowledgments in scientific papers may give an insight into aspects of the scientific community, such as reward systems, collaboration patterns, and hidden research trends. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the performance of different embedding models for the task of automatic extraction and classification of acknowledged entities from the acknowledgment text in scientific papers. We trained and implemented a named entity recognition (NER) task using the flair NLP framework. The training was conducted using three default Flair NER models with four differently-sized corpora and different versions of the flair NLP framework. The Flair Embeddings model trained on the medium corpus with the latest FLAIR version showed the best accuracy of 0.79. Expanding the size of a training corpus from very small to medium size massively increased the accuracy of all training algorithms, but further expansion of the training corpus did not bring further improvement. Moreover, the performance of the model slightly deteriorated. Our model is able to recognize six entity types: funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation, and miscellaneous. The model works more precisely for some entity types than for others; thus, individuals and grant numbers showed a very good F1-Score over 0.9. Most of the previous works on acknowledgment analysis were limited by the manual evaluation of data and therefore by the amount of processed data.

Overall, we find evidence for both negative (i.e., disadvantageous for response quality) and positive (i.e., advantageous for response quality) panel conditioning. Highly experienced respondents were more likely to satisfice by speeding through the questionnaire. They also had a higher probability of refusing to answer sensitive questions than less experienced panel members. However, more experienced respondents were also more likely to optimize the response process by needing less time compared to panelists with lower experience levels (when controlling for speeding).

"Migration, daily commuting, or second residence? The role of location-specific capital and distance to workplace in regional mobility decisions","{BACKGROUND If a new job is located in a different region from the place of residence, individuals or households can choose between moving or commuting. However, so far mobility alternatives and their drivers remain under-researched from a comparative perspective. OBJECTIVE We investigate the determinants of the mobility choices of individuals who have taken a distant job (50 km or more), considering three options, (1) permanent migration, (2) daily commuting, (3) weekly commuting (i.e., a second residence), thereby focusing on the interplay between migration costs linked to different sources of location-specific capital (property ownership, working partner, school-age children) and transition costs linked to the distance travelled. METHODS We use longitudinal data from the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP, 2001–2019) and estimate probit regression models with Heckman correction to account for sample selection. RESULTS We find that a large distance to the workplace favors the decision to migrate or to commute weekly, while a high endowment with location-specific capital favors daily or weekly commuting. Weekly commuting is particularly chosen when both migration and transition costs are very high. However, parents of school-age children are more inclined to commute daily, suggesting that they are often more willing to accept high transition costs than to be separated from their family during the week.

SEQUENTIAL AND CONCURRENT MIXED-MODE DESIGNS: A TAILORED APPROACH,"{Due to rising costs and declining response rates, surveys are increasingly moving from face-to-face interviewing to a self-administered mixed-mode design. Mixed-mode surveys can be conducted using a concurrent or a sequential design. A sequential design in which the web mode is offered first is a common strategy for mixed-mode surveys as it reduces survey costs. However, when deciding which mode choice sequence to use, sample balance should also be considered. One approach to achieving a balanced sample might be to tailor the sequence of the choice of modes, or the mode choice sequence. For this purpose, we use an indicator that assigns the sampled persons to the different mode choice sequences to minimize the variability of response probabilities. In this study, we compare the sample composition achieved with a concurrent and a sequential design. Additionally, we investigate whether indicator-based tailoring of the two mode choice sequences can improve sample composition. We implemented a randomized experiment in the 2021 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), which surveyed the general population aged 18 and older in private households (N 5,342) using a mixed-mode design (web and mail). In a first step, respondents were randomly assigned to a concurrent or a sequential design. We find that the two mode choice sequences lead to a similar sample composition.

Beyond Facts: 4th International Workshop on Computational Methods for Online Discourse Analysis,"{Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts (events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. Computational methods, mostly from the field of NLP, have emerged that tackle a wide range of tasks in this context, including argument and opinion mining, claim detection, checkworthiness detection, stance detection or fact verification. However, computational models require robust definitions of classes and concepts under investigation. Thus, these computational tasks require a strong interdisciplinary and epistemological foundation, specifically with respect to the underlying definitions of key concepts such as claims, arguments, stances, check-worthiness or veracity. This requires a highly interdisciplinary approach combining expertise from fields such as communication studies, computational linguistics and computer science. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex.

Method: To test our preregistered hypotheses, we rely on data from multiple waves of a representative survey among the German population (N = 2,883). The need for cognitive closure and general political trust was assessed before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, while belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and specific trust in handling the crisis was fielded during the second wave of the pandemic. Results: We find that individuals with a high need for cognitive closure are more likely to accept conspiracy narratives, but the effect size is small. At the same time, pre-pandemic trust and concurrent trust in political and medical institutions are strongly negatively related to conspiracy beliefs. We find no support for a moderating effect of political trust.

We found that employment growth benefits poverty reduction, but this positive effect was partially offset by the precarious characteristics of some newly created jobs. If the distribution of jobs had favoured the jobless more in the pre-crisis period, the relative income poverty rate would have been lower. Although the share of persons in jobless households decreased during the recovery years, their risk of poverty increased due to the retrenchment of social transfers during and after the Great Recession.

Introduction,"{German unification can be viewed as a case study when it comes to analyzing transformation processes. To understand and investigate these processes, this chapter follows two main goals. First, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of the historical setting. This introduction thus serves as an overarching chapter, giving a short overview of differences in political systems and ideology during the time of the German separation, the rapprochement and transformation process as well as discussions about possible causes for persisting differences. It will explain how the perspectives taken in the following parts and individual chapters tie together to form a picture of transformation processes in Germany.

Investigating respondents’ willingness to participate in video-based web surveys,"{Recent developments in communication technology and changes in people’s communication habits facilitate new data collection forms in web surveys. Technical devices, such as computers, tablets, and smartphones, enable researchers to rethink established communication forms and add a human touch to web surveys. Designing web surveys more human-like has the great potential to make communication between researchers and respondents more natural, which may result in higher survey satisfaction and data quality. Considering the existing survey literature, there are only a few studies investigating respondents’ willingness for new communication forms in web surveys. Hence, in the present study, we explore respondents’ willingness to take part in web surveys to have interviewers read questions via pre-recorded videos (question delivery) and in which respondents provide their answers orally via self-recorded videos (question answering). We included two willingness questions – one on question delivery via pre-recorded videos and one on question answering via self-recorded videos – in the non-probability SoSci panel in Germany. The results reveal that respondents’ willingness to have questions read by interviewers is higher than their willingness to self-record video answers. Believing that technology facilitates communication and perceiving the survey as being interesting increases willingness, whereas evaluating the survey topic as sensitive decreases willingness.

SEQUENTIAL AND CONCURRENT MIXED-MODE DESIGNS: A TAILORED APPROACH,"{Due to rising costs and declining response rates, surveys are increasingly moving from face-to-face interviewing to a self-administered mixed-mode design. Mixed-mode surveys can be conducted using a concurrent or a sequential design. A sequential design in which the web mode is offered first is a common strategy for mixed-mode surveys as it reduces survey costs. However, when deciding which mode choice sequence to use, sample balance should also be considered. One approach to achieving a balanced sample might be to tailor the sequence of the choice of modes, or the mode choice sequence. For this purpose, we use an indicator that assigns the sampled persons to the different mode choice sequences to minimize the variability of response probabilities. In this study, we compare the sample composition achieved with a concurrent and a sequential design. Additionally, we investigate whether indicator-based tailoring of the two mode choice sequences can improve sample composition. We implemented a randomized experiment in the 2021 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), which surveyed the general population aged 18 and older in private households (N 5,342) using a mixed-mode design (web and mail). In a first step, respondents were randomly assigned to a concurrent or a sequential design. We find that the two mode choice sequences lead to a similar sample composition.

"Changes in economic deprivation and parental self-efficacy: Unemployment, poverty, and the mediating effect of psychological distress","{Objective: The article investigates the influence of three aspects of economic deprivation on parental selfefficacy, and whether, or to what extent, these effects are mediated by psychological distress. Background: Scholarship shows that psychological resources such as parental self-efficacy can attenuate the negative repercussions of poverty for families. The article builds on the family stress model that higlights the role of economic deprivation for family functioning by Conger and colleagues. It focuses on the consequences of transitioning into unemployment, objective poverty, and subjective poverty for parental selfefficacy, and the potential mediating effect of psychological distress. Method: Using data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) Waves 4 to 12 (2011–2020), Baron and Kenny mediation analyses are conducted based on fixed effects regressions with standard errors based on clustered bootstrap procedure. Results: The results show that transitioning into subjective poverty significantly decreases parental selfefficacy, and that only a marginal part of this effect is mediated by psychological distress. A transition into objective poverty, by contrast, has no effect on parental self-efficacy. Likewise, unemployment has no direct effect on parental self-efficacy. However, transitioning into short-term unemployment reduces psychological distress and thereby buffers parent’s self-efficacy. This does by contrast not apply for long-term unemployment. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the importance of differentiating between specific aspects of economic deprivation when investigating its consequences for parental self-efficacy and considering psychological distress as a potential mediator.

Measuring the Four Higher-Order Values in Schwartz’s Theory: Validation of a 17-Item Inventory,"{Schwartz’s theory of basic human values is the dominant framework for assessing values. One of its strengths is that it allows for different levels of analysis. The 10 basic values can be reliably assigned to four higher-order dimensions: Openness to Change, Conservation, Self-Transcendence, and Self-Enhancement. In this paper, we examined the psychometric properties of the Higher-Order-Value Scale-17 (HOVS17), an inventory that economically assesses these higher-order values. We analyzed data from the GESIS Panel, an ongoing large-scale probability-based panel study that fields HOVS17 annually since 2013 and for which HOVS17 was originally developed. We found HOVS17 to have satisfactory psychometric properties. The 17 items were located in the two-dimensional multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) space as hypothesized. All four subscales were unidimensional, showed good fit when modeled as reflective latent variables, and had acceptable reliabilities as well as one-year test–retest stabilities (.65 to.69). The subscales correlated in theoretically plausible ways with a wide range of correlates and criteria, such as personality traits and well-being. This demonstrates that HOVS17 provides a sound basis for studying the development, precursors, and consequences of the higher-order values in the GESIS Panel and in future surveys that adopt HOVS17.

Individual and gender inequality in computer science: A career study of cohorts from 1970 to 2000,"{Inequality prevails in science. Individual inequality means that most perish quickly and only a few are successful, and gender inequality implies that there are differences in achievements for women and men. Using large-scale bibliographic data and following a computational approach, we study the evolution of individual and gender inequality for cohorts from 1970 to 2000 in the whole field of computer science as it grows and becomes a team-based science.

It will explain how the perspectives taken in the following parts and individual chapters tie together to form a picture of transformation processes in Germany. Second, this chapter serves as a methodological guide through different statistical approaches that may be used to analyze societal and individual changes over time by pointing out common pitfalls of study designs and methods used in transformation research.

"Putting authoritarianism in context: A multilevel analysis of regional effects on individual expressions of right-wing authoritarianism, conspiracy mentality, and superstition","{Ever since its original conception, authoritarianism is claimed to be the driving force behind various forms of anti-modern attitudes and politics. While current research mainly focuses on three dimensions of right-wing authoritarianism, namely authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, and conventionalism, the original F-scale was more extensive, including conspiracy mentality and superstition among others. Based on recent empirical observations as well as theoretical claims, this chapter suggests revisiting these concepts. Using a German representative sample (N = 2,522), notable differences between East and West Germany for all five subdimensions were observed in 2022. Multilevel analyses were used to identify and disentangle individual factors as well as sociostructural context factors, which may be responsible for these differences and codetermine the prevalence of the dimensions of authoritarian attitudes. Our analyses reveal that significant regional differences, which go beyond mere East-West differences in authoritarian attitudes in Germany, can partly be explained by the selected context variables. Moreover, collective experiences of deprivation interact with average household income on the district level, and this interaction helps predict authoritarian aggression and submission as well as conspiracy mentality.

The association between system-justifying ideologies and attitudes toward the social market economy in Germany,"{Although the legitimacy of an economic system is often dependent on citizen support, psychological research has paid little attention to attitudes toward economic systems. In the present study, we examined the link between two system-justifying ideologies, namely, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), and attitudes toward the social market economy in Germany. Drawing on system justification theory, we hypothesized that RWA would be positively and SDO negatively associated with support for the social market economy because the social component of the German economic system conflicts with beliefs inherent in SDO favoring a group-based hierarchy. Based on a quota sample of German adults (N = 886), we found support for the predicted associations of both system-justifying ideologies with economic system support, except that RWA was negatively associated with support for the welfare component of the social market economy. However, the positive relationship of RWA with support for the social market economy only emerged after SDO was statistically controlled, suggesting a suppressor situation.

Gendered wage returns to changes in non-routine job tasks: Evidence from Germany,"{The labor market exhibits persistent occupational segregation by gender, with women and men performing distinct job tasks within their occupations.

Men benefit from performing more complex and autonomous tasks, with additional gains when an inter-segmental job change accompanies the increase in complex job tasks.

CooRTweet: A Generalized R Software for Coordinated Network Detection,"{This paper introduces CooRTweet, an innovative R package designed for detecting and analyzing coordinated behavior. CooRTweet’s distinctiveness lies in its essential architecture, derived from a minimal definition of coordinated behavior that captures its core elements in an abstract way. This approach makes it possible for the tool to be applied to the widest range of cases, from mono-modal network analysis on a single social media platform, to multi-modal and cross-platform network analysis, and to any types of objects shared by a network, whether singular identical objects (e.g., the same tweet), similar objects (e.g., clusters of similar images), or complex objects (e.g., a combination of hashtags, images, and emojis). Additionally, it offers a comprehensive view of coordinated activities that include both explicit coordination and organic forms of content sharing. The comprehensive architecture of CooRTweet provides flexibility and a broad scope for analyzing coordinated activities across various digital landscapes. This positions it as a distinctive resource for researchers investigating coordinated communication online. More generally, CooRTweet provides a valuable example to methodologists and research tool developers of how software tools for research can be developed in a generalized and thus flexible way. This is particularly important for social media research, given how quickly new APIs are being released, modified, and even shut down.

Toeing the Party Line: Election Manifestos as a Key to Understand Political Discourse on Twitter,"{Political discourse on Twitter is a moving target: politicians continuously make statements about their positions. It is therefore crucial to track their discourse on social media to understand their ideological positions and goals. However, Twitter data is also challenging to work with since it is ambiguous and often dependent on social context, and consequently, recent work on political positioning has tended to focus strongly on manifestos (parties' electoral programs) rather than social media. In this paper, we extend recently proposed methods to predict pairwise positional similarities between parties from the manifesto case to the Twitter case, using hashtags as a signal to fine-tune text representations, without the need for manual annotation. We verify the efficacy of fine-tuning and conduct a series of experiments that assess the robustness of our method for low-resource scenarios. We find that our method yields stable positioning reflective of manifesto positioning, both in scenarios with all tweets of candidates across years available and when only smaller subsets from shorter time periods are available.

Why we need to abandon fixed cutoffs for goodness-of-fit indices: An extensive simulation and possible solutions,"{To evaluate model fit in confirmatory factor analysis, researchers compare goodness-of-fit indices (GOFs) against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI >.950) derived from simulation studies. Methodologists have cautioned that cutoffs for GOFs are only valid for settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which cutoffs originated. Despite these warnings, fixed cutoffs for popular GOFs (i.e., χ2, χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) continue to be widely used in applied research. We (1) argue that the practice of using fixed cutoffs needs to be abandoned and (2) review time-honored and emerging alternatives to fixed cutoffs. We first present the most in-depth simulation study to date on the sensitivity of GOFs to model misspecification (i.e., misspecified factor dimensionality and unmodeled cross-loadings) and their susceptibility to further data and analysis characteristics (i.e., estimator, number of indicators, number and distribution of response options, loading magnitude, sample size, and factor correlation). We included all characteristics identified as influential in previous studies. Our simulation enabled us to replicate well-known influences on GOFs and establish hitherto unknown or underappreciated ones. In particular, the magnitude of the factor correlation turned out to moderate the effects of several characteristics on GOFs. Second, to address these problems, we discuss several strategies for assessing model fit that take the dependency of GOFs on the modeling context into account.

However, this gender gap in literacy seems to “disappear” during adulthood. Up until today, only a few studies investigated the role of assessment features in gender differences in literacy performance in adulthood. This study aims to understand the relationship between assessment features and gender differences in literacy skills. Methods: Using the German 2012 PIAAC data (N = 4,512), we applied item-level analyses using linear probability models to examine gender differences in the probability of solving a literacy item correctly with six assessment features including (1) text format, (2) text topics, (3) text length, (4) cognitive strategies, (5) numerical content of the text/questions, and (6) gender typicality of content. Results: We found that men had a 13.4% higher probability of solving items with a noncontinuous text format correctly than women. Men also had a 9.4% higher probability of solving short text items correctly and a 4.6% higher probability of solving items with a medium/high numerical content in the question correctly than women. There were small to negligible gender differences in literacy performance in terms of text topics, cognitive strategies, and gender typicality of content. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the role of text format, text length, and numerical content in gender differences in literacy skills, suggesting that further refining these practices can enhance the fairness and accuracy of literacy assessments. Specifically, we advocate for ongoing research aimed at understanding and minimizing the potential bias introduced by these assessment features. Such efforts are not only crucial for developing instruments that accurately measure literacy skills, but they also yield insights that hold significant implications for educational researchers and practitioners dedicated to creating more equitable assessment environments.}",2024,Large-Scale Assessments in Education,,Education,Social Sciences,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2024,"gender differences in literacy in piaac: do assessment features matter? {background: previous research based on large-scale studies consistently suggests that on average, male students tend to have lower literacy compared to their female students during secondary schooling. however, this gender gap in literacy seems to “disappear” during adulthood. up until today, only a few studies investigated the role of assessment features in gender differences in literacy performance in adulthood. this study aims to understand the relationship between assessment features and gender differences in literacy skills. methods: using the german 2012 piaac data (n = 4,512), we applied item-level analyses using linear probability models to examine gender differences in the probability of solving a literacy item correctly with six assessment features including (1) text format, (2) text topics, (3) text length, (4) cognitive strategies, (5) numerical content of the text/questions, and (6) gender typicality of content. results: we found that men had a 13.4% higher probability of solving items with a noncontinuous text format correctly than women. men also had a 9.4% higher probability of solving short text items correctly and a 4.6% higher probability of solving items with a medium/high numerical content in the question correctly than women. there were small to negligible gender differences in literacy performance in terms of text topics, cognitive strategies, and gender typicality of content. conclusions: our findings highlight the role of text format, text length, and numerical content in gender differences in literacy skills, suggesting that further refining these practices can enhance the fairness and accuracy of literacy assessments. specifically, we advocate for ongoing research aimed at understanding and minimizing the potential bias introduced by these assessment features. such efforts are not only crucial for developing instruments that accurately measure literacy skills, but they also yield insights that hold significant implications for educational researchers and practitioners dedicated to creating more equitable assessment environments.}",0,1.0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election"

Does temporary employment increase length of commuting? Longitudinal evidence from Australia and Germany,"{On average, temporary jobs are far less stable than permanent jobs.

As expected, the results show that the link between temporary employment and commuting length varies by employment type and institutional context. Agency work is associated with longer commutes than permanent work in both countries, whereas this applies to fixed-term contracts for Germany only.

Why we need to abandon fixed cutoffs for goodness-of-fit indices: An extensive simulation and possible solutions,"{To evaluate model fit in confirmatory factor analysis, researchers compare goodness-of-fit indices (GOFs) against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI >.950) derived from simulation studies. Methodologists have cautioned that cutoffs for GOFs are only valid for settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which cutoffs originated. Despite these warnings, fixed cutoffs for popular GOFs (i.e., χ2, χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) continue to be widely used in applied research. We (1) argue that the practice of using fixed cutoffs needs to be abandoned and (2) review time-honored and emerging alternatives to fixed cutoffs. We first present the most in-depth simulation study to date on the sensitivity of GOFs to model misspecification (i.e., misspecified factor dimensionality and unmodeled cross-loadings) and their susceptibility to further data and analysis characteristics (i.e., estimator, number of indicators, number and distribution of response options, loading magnitude, sample size, and factor correlation). We included all characteristics identified as influential in previous studies. Our simulation enabled us to replicate well-known influences on GOFs and establish hitherto unknown or underappreciated ones. In particular, the magnitude of the factor correlation turned out to moderate the effects of several characteristics on GOFs.

Large language models as a substitute for human experts in annotating political text,"{Large-scale text analysis has grown rapidly as a method in political science and beyond. To date, text-as-data methods rely on large volumes of human-annotated training examples, which place a premium on researcher resources. However, advances in large language models (LLMs) may make automated annotation increasingly viable. This paper tests the performance of GPT-4 across a range of scenarios relevant for analysis of political text. We compare GPT-4 coding with human expert coding of tweets and news articles across four variables (whether text is political, its negativity, its sentiment, and its ideology) and across four countries (the United States, Chile, Germany, and Italy). GPT-4 coding is highly accurate, especially for shorter texts such as tweets, correctly classifying texts up to 95% of the time. Performance drops for longer news articles, and very slightly for non-English text.

The (fe-)male breadwinner?

They differ between birth cohorts, depend on individual age, and change over time. In recent years, a certain retraditionalization was observed, especially in younger East German birth cohorts.

Methods: Using data from seven cross sections (1992 to 2016) of an East German sample of the German General Social Survey (N = 5,426), hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) analyses were applied to simultaneously estimate the effects of age, birth cohort, and time period on gender role beliefs. Results: Significant cohort effects were observed, with those cohorts born and raised in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) showing the most egalitarian views.

The Austrian Political Advertisement Scandal: Patterns of “Journalism for Sale”,"{Mounting concern surrounds the influence of political actors on journalism, especially as media outlets face increasing financial pressures.

Do social engagement skills exist and matter beyond personality facet traits and vocational interests? A generalization study across six countries,"{Social engagement skills as capacities for active interpersonal engagement are thought to conceptually differ from behavioral and motivational tendencies and to predict learning and life outcomes. We tested these assumptions on the distinct nature and relevance of social engagement skills. Quota-representative self-reports from 6987 adults in six countries showed strong relations of social engagement skills with personality facets and weaker with vocational interests. Partially supporting their distinctiveness, social engagement skills were not fully reducible to those correlates. Skills predicted self-reported learning, quality-of-life, and job outcomes, but offered little incremental validity beyond personality and interests. Results largely generalized across countries. Yet, the complex interplay between social engagement skills, individual differences, and outcomes demonstrated cross-country variations, suggesting sensitivity to sociocontextual factors. We conclude that while social engagement skills conceptually differ from personality and interests and in themselves predict life success, they add limited empirical value beyond these constructs, at least for self-reports. Educational relevance statement: Social engagement skills are the capacities to actively engage with others. It is thought that these capacities differ from other person characteristics (e.g., behavioral or motivational tendencies), and that this distinction matters for explaining life success. Our study showed that while self-reported social engagement skills shared similarities with other person characteristics, they still had unique aspects. Moreover, social engagement skills mattered, such that more skilled adults reported higher quality-of-life, but not necessarily better learning. However, social engagement skills did not provide much extra insight into life success beyond what was already known from other person characteristics. Other than the remaining results, these complex relations between social engagement skills, person characteristics, and life success largely varied across countries. The results highlight the importance of assessing social skills in a situation-specific manner, which will be imperative for targeted educational practices in the future. Moreover, our study focused on adults, limiting applicability to youth, but results suggest that intervention efforts targeting social engagement skills may probably yield more interpersonal than academic benefits.

Linguistic feature fusion for Arabic fake news detection and named entity recognition using reinforcement learning and swarm optimization,"{In the context of the escalating use of social media in Arabic-speaking countries, driven by improved internet access, affordable smartphones, and a growing digital connectivity trend, this study addresses a significant challenge: the widespread dissemination of fake news. The ease and rapidity of spreading information on social media, coupled with a lack of stringent fact-checking measures, exacerbate the issue of misinformation. Our study examines how language features, especially Named Entity Recognition (NER) features, play a role in detecting fake news. We built two models: an AraBERT Multi-task Learning (MTL) based one for classifying Arabic fake news, and a token classification model that focuses on fake news NER features.

Large language models as a substitute for human experts in annotating political text,"{Large-scale text analysis has grown rapidly as a method in political science and beyond. To date, text-as-data methods rely on large volumes of human-annotated training examples, which place a premium on researcher resources. However, advances in large language models (LLMs) may make automated annotation increasingly viable. This paper tests the performance of GPT-4 across a range of scenarios relevant for analysis of political text. We compare GPT-4 coding with human expert coding of tweets and news articles across four variables (whether text is political, its negativity, its sentiment, and its ideology) and across four countries (the United States, Chile, Germany, and Italy). GPT-4 coding is highly accurate, especially for shorter texts such as tweets, correctly classifying texts up to 95% of the time. Performance drops for longer news articles, and very slightly for non-English text. We introduce a ‘hybrid’ coding approach, in which disagreements of multiple GPT-4 runs are adjudicated by a human expert, which boosts accuracy. Finally, we explore downstream effects, finding that transformer models trained on hand-coded or GPT-4-coded data yield almost identical outcomes.

Investigating respondents’ willingness to participate in video-based web surveys,"{Recent developments in communication technology and changes in people’s communication habits facilitate new data collection forms in web surveys. Technical devices, such as computers, tablets, and smartphones, enable researchers to rethink established communication forms and add a human touch to web surveys. Designing web surveys more human-like has the great potential to make communication between researchers and respondents more natural, which may result in higher survey satisfaction and data quality. Considering the existing survey literature, there are only a few studies investigating respondents’ willingness for new communication forms in web surveys. Hence, in the present study, we explore respondents’ willingness to take part in web surveys to have interviewers read questions via pre-recorded videos (question delivery) and in which respondents provide their answers orally via self-recorded videos (question answering). We included two willingness questions – one on question delivery via pre-recorded videos and one on question answering via self-recorded videos – in the non-probability SoSci panel in Germany.

How does broadband supply affect participation in panel surveys?: Using geospatial broadband data at the district level to analyze mode choice and panel attrition,"{Good broadband supply is crucial for different aspects of participation behavior in web surveys. In this study, we combined geospatial broadband data and the survey data of 16 waves of the mixed-mode GESIS Panel to investigate mode choice and panel attrition.

In the first part of the analysis, we investigated the effects of broadband supply on mode choice. The results showed a positive effect of the broadband category with the highest coverage rate on choosing the online mode. We also found effects for internet familiarity, age, and education. In the second part, we investigated the effects of broadband supply on panel attrition within the 16 survey waves. We did not find significant effects of broadband supply on panel attrition.

Do social engagement skills exist and matter beyond personality facet traits and vocational interests? A generalization study across six countries,"{Social engagement skills as capacities for active interpersonal engagement are thought to conceptually differ from behavioral and motivational tendencies and to predict learning and life outcomes. We tested these assumptions on the distinct nature and relevance of social engagement skills. Quota-representative self-reports from 6987 adults in six countries showed strong relations of social engagement skills with personality facets and weaker with vocational interests. Partially supporting their distinctiveness, social engagement skills were not fully reducible to those correlates. Skills predicted self-reported learning, quality-of-life, and job outcomes, but offered little incremental validity beyond personality and interests. Results largely generalized across countries. Yet, the complex interplay between social engagement skills, individual differences, and outcomes demonstrated cross-country variations, suggesting sensitivity to sociocontextual factors. We conclude that while social engagement skills conceptually differ from personality and interests and in themselves predict life success, they add limited empirical value beyond these constructs, at least for self-reports. Educational relevance statement: Social engagement skills are the capacities to actively engage with others. It is thought that these capacities differ from other person characteristics (e.g., behavioral or motivational tendencies), and that this distinction matters for explaining life success. Our study showed that while self-reported social engagement skills shared similarities with other person characteristics, they still had unique aspects. Moreover, social engagement skills mattered, such that more skilled adults reported higher quality-of-life, but not necessarily better learning. However, social engagement skills did not provide much extra insight into life success beyond what was already known from other person characteristics. Other than the remaining results, these complex relations between social engagement skills, person characteristics, and life success largely varied across countries. The results highlight the importance of assessing social skills in a situation-specific manner, which will be imperative for targeted educational practices in the future. Moreover, our study focused on adults, limiting applicability to youth, but results suggest that intervention efforts targeting social engagement skills may probably yield more interpersonal than academic benefits.

Careless whisper: Political elite discourses activate national identities for far-right voting preferences,"{While exclusionary national identities are widespread among Europeans, relatively few people vote for the far right in most countries. Thus, an exclusionary identity in many cases does not lead to voting for the most nativist types of parties. We explain this empirical puzzle by showing that these identities need to be activated to become behaviourally relevant. To this end, we analyse longitudinal comparative data of over 135,000 individuals across more than 26 years and 26 countries combining different survey programmes and manifesto data.

Panel Conditioning in A Probability-based Longitudinal study: A Comparison of Respondents with Different Levels of Survey Experience,"{Learning effects due to repeated interviewing, also known as panel conditioning, are a major threat to response quality in later waves of a panel study. To date, research has not provided a clear picture regarding the circumstances, mechanisms, and dimensions of potential panel conditioning effects. In particular, the effects of conditioning frequency, that is, different levels of experience within a panel, on response quality are underexplored. Against this background, we investigated the effects of panel conditioning by using data from the GESIS Panel, a German mixed-mode probability-based panel study. Using two refreshment samples, we compared three panel cohorts with differing levels of experience on several response quality indicators related to the mechanisms of reflection, satisficing, and social desirability. Overall, we find evidence for both negative (i.e., disadvantageous for response quality) and positive (i.e., advantageous for response quality) panel conditioning. Highly experienced respondents were more likely to satisfice by speeding through the questionnaire. They also had a higher probability of refusing to answer sensitive questions than less experienced panel members. However, more experienced respondents were also more likely to optimize the response process by needing less time compared to panelists with lower experience levels (when controlling for speeding). In contrast, we did not find significant differences with respect to the number of ""don't know""responses, nondifferentiation, the selection of first response categories and mid-responses, and the number of nontriggered filter questions.

Do Online Ads Sway Voters? Understanding the Persuasiveness of Online Political Ads,"{This study investigates the effect of online political ads on party preference, and whether this effect is more pronounced for newer political parties and voters who are less politically knowledgeable and literate regarding online privacy. A mixed-method approach, combining Facebook browser tracking data and a four-wave panel survey, was adopted during the 2021 Dutch General Election campaign. The results showed that the number of political ads received from a specific party has a positive effect on both the propensity and choice to vote for that party. In addition, people with less political knowledge and online privacy literacy are more likely to be persuaded by online political ads. However, at the party level, there is no evidence indicating that the effect of political ads on party preference is stronger for new parties than for established parties.

The ethnic penalty in welfare deservingness: A factorial survey experiment on welfare chauvinism in pension attitudes in Germany,"{This study investigates whether pensioners with a foreign ethnic background are perceived as less deserving to receive a pension than are native pensioners.

Our study thus adds to existing research by examining a less likely case to find welfare chauvinistic attitudes.

Survey respondents decide on the amount of pension benefits that a hypothetical pensioner should receive.

Antisemitism in East and W est Germany: Three decades after the wall: a comparative longitudinal study considering age-period-cohort effects,"{Since the unification of the two German states in 1990, antisemitic attitudes have been repeatedly polled in cross-sectional or longitudinal national surveys (e.g., the long-term GFE surveys). So far, comparative studies analyzing the development of antisemitism in East and West Germany over a longer time period are scarce. The study covers a time span of 30 years to investigate two forms of antisemitism (classical and secondary), especially with respect to inner-German differences. Applying model-based age-period-cohort analyses (APC) with a total of 19 available representative surveys (maximal period: 1991-2021), theory-driven hypotheses are tested. The statistical approach and respective findings are discussed with emphasis on several challenges accompanying the utilized heterogenous data and different survey modes. Findings reveal that life-cycle effects play a decisive role in the attitudinal development and distribution of antisemitic attitudes.

Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,"{This book examines the increasing body of research dedicated to the lasting differences between the former separate states of the Federal German Republic (FRG) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Thirty years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it takes a broad view on German unification and transformation research. Transformation and unification processes in East and West Germany are still ongoing, and they may serve as a model for social change and its political, economic, and psychological consequences. Using advanced statistical methods of analysis, this edited volume provides insights into the valuable contextualization of individual and social phenomena that current research on German unification and transformation is producing. Following the open science mindset using code and data, the authors investigate temporal trends in (1) mental health, (2) political attitudes, and (3) work and family life. It explores changes in mental health and political attitudes, as well as continued differences in work and family arrangements, that may stem from heterogeneous experiences within the systems and during the transformation process.

Is there a geography of Euroscepticism among the winners and losers of globalization?,"{Support for EU membership has long been an important topic of study. Individual-level research shows that winners of globalisation, including the higher educated, express greater EU support as they profit from economic and cultural conditions resulting from European integration. Recent context-focused work suggests that individuals in ‘left-behind’ places are less supportive of EU integration because of their home regions’ weaker long-term economic conditions. This paper brings these two research strands into conversation with each other by examining how the relationship between EU support and individual-level education is contingent on subnational economic conditions. Using harmonised Eurobarometer data from almost 750,000 respondents spanning 2004–2019, combined with subnational economic data from 201 European regions, we find no evidence that subnational economic conditions influence the relationship between EU support and respondents’ education level. At the same time, when cross-sectionally comparing long-term differences between regions, we find that EU support is positively related to regional GDP per capita (though unrelated to regional unemployment), among both the higher and lower educated, and especially in the post-Great Recession period.

Measuring the Four Higher-Order Values in Schwartz’s Theory: Validation of a 17-Item Inventory,"{Schwartz’s theory of basic human values is the dominant framework for assessing values.

In this paper, we examined the psychometric properties of the Higher-Order-Value Scale-17 (HOVS17), an inventory that economically assesses these higher-order values. We analyzed data from the GESIS Panel, an ongoing large-scale probability-based panel study that fields HOVS17 annually since 2013 and for which HOVS17 was originally developed. We found HOVS17 to have satisfactory psychometric properties. The 17 items were located in the two-dimensional multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) space as hypothesized. All four subscales were unidimensional, showed good fit when modeled as reflective latent variables, and had acceptable reliabilities as well as one-year test–retest stabilities (.65 to.69). The subscales correlated in theoretically plausible ways with a wide range of correlates and criteria, such as personality traits and well-being. This demonstrates that HOVS17 provides a sound basis for studying the development, precursors, and consequences of the higher-order values in the GESIS Panel and in future surveys that adopt HOVS17.

INNOVATING WEB PROBING: COMPARING WRITTEN AND ORAL ANSWERS TO OPEN-ENDED PROBING QUESTIONS IN A SMARTPHONE SURVEY,"{Cognitive interviewing in the form of probing is key for developing methodologically sound survey questions. For a long time, probing was tied to the laboratory setting, making it difficult to achieve large sample sizes and creating a time-intensive undertaking for both researchers and participants.

In so-called web probing studies, respondents first answer a question and then they receive one or more open-ended questions about their response process, with requests for written answers. However, participants frequently provide very short or no answers at all to open-ended questions, in part because answering questions in writing is tedious. This is especially the case when the web survey is completed via a smartphone with a virtual on-screen keypad that shrinks the viewing space.

AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images,"{Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052 % were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform.

CooRTweet: A Generalized R Software for Coordinated Network Detection,"{This paper introduces CooRTweet, an innovative R package designed for detecting and analyzing coordinated behavior. CooRTweet’s distinctiveness lies in its essential architecture, derived from a minimal definition of coordinated behavior that captures its core elements in an abstract way. This approach makes it possible for the tool to be applied to the widest range of cases, from mono-modal network analysis on a single social media platform, to multi-modal and cross-platform network analysis, and to any types of objects shared by a network, whether singular identical objects (e.g., the same tweet), similar objects (e.g., clusters of similar images), or complex objects (e.g., a combination of hashtags, images, and emojis). Additionally, it offers a comprehensive view of coordinated activities that include both explicit coordination and organic forms of content sharing. The comprehensive architecture of CooRTweet provides flexibility and a broad scope for analyzing coordinated activities across various digital landscapes. This positions it as a distinctive resource for researchers investigating coordinated communication online. More generally, CooRTweet provides a valuable example to methodologists and research tool developers of how software tools for research can be developed in a generalized and thus flexible way. This is particularly important for social media research, given how quickly new APIs are being released, modified, and even shut down.

Is there a geography of Euroscepticism among the winners and losers of globalization?,"{Support for EU membership has long been an important topic of study. Individual-level research shows that winners of globalisation, including the higher educated, express greater EU support as they profit from economic and cultural conditions resulting from European integration. Recent context-focused work suggests that individuals in ‘left-behind’ places are less supportive of EU integration because of their home regions’ weaker long-term economic conditions. This paper brings these two research strands into conversation with each other by examining how the relationship between EU support and individual-level education is contingent on subnational economic conditions. Using harmonised Eurobarometer data from almost 750,000 respondents spanning 2004–2019, combined with subnational economic data from 201 European regions, we find no evidence that subnational economic conditions influence the relationship between EU support and respondents’ education level. At the same time, when cross-sectionally comparing long-term differences between regions, we find that EU support is positively related to regional GDP per capita (though unrelated to regional unemployment), among both the higher and lower educated, and especially in the post-Great Recession period.

Panel Conditioning in A Probability-based Longitudinal study: A Comparison of Respondents with Different Levels of Survey Experience,"{Learning effects due to repeated interviewing, also known as panel conditioning, are a major threat to response quality in later waves of a panel study.

Interviewer-Observed Paradata in Mixed-Mode and Innovative Data Collection,"{In this research note, we address the potentials of using interviewer-observed paradata, typically collected during face-to-face-only interviews, in mixed-mode and innovative data collection methods that involve an interviewer at some stage (e.g., during the initial contact or during the interview). To this end, we first provide a systematic overview of the types and purposes of the interviewer-observed paradata most commonly collected in face-to-face interviews—contact form data, interviewer observations, and interviewer evaluations—using the methodology of evidence mapping.

Argument Quality Assessment in the Age of Instruction-Following Large Language Models,"{The computational treatment of arguments on controversial issues has been subject to extensive NLP research, due to its envisioned impact on opinion formation, decision making, writing education, and the like.

On or off topic?

Don’t Keep It Too Simple Simplified Items Do Not Improve Measurement Quality,"{When formulating questionnaire items, generally accepted rules include: Keeping the wording as simple as possible and avoiding double-barreled items. However, the empirical basis for these rules is sparse. The present study aimed to systematically investigate in an experimental design whether simplifying items of a personality scale and avoiding double-barreled items (i.e., items that contain multiple stimuli) markedly increases psychometric quality. Specifically, we compared the original items of the Big Five Inventory-2 – most of which are either double-barreled or can be regarded as complexly formulated – with simplified versions of the items. We tested the two versions using a large, heterogeneous sample (N = 2,234). The simplified versions did not possess better psychometric quality than their original counterparts; rather, they showed weaker factorial validity.

Why we need to abandon fixed cutoffs for goodness-of-fit indices: An extensive simulation and possible solutions,"{To evaluate model fit in confirmatory factor analysis, researchers compare goodness-of-fit indices (GOFs) against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI >.950) derived from simulation studies. Methodologists have cautioned that cutoffs for GOFs are only valid for settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which cutoffs originated. Despite these warnings, fixed cutoffs for popular GOFs (i.e., χ2, χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) continue to be widely used in applied research. We (1) argue that the practice of using fixed cutoffs needs to be abandoned and (2) review time-honored and emerging alternatives to fixed cutoffs. We first present the most in-depth simulation study to date on the sensitivity of GOFs to model misspecification (i.e., misspecified factor dimensionality and unmodeled cross-loadings) and their susceptibility to further data and analysis characteristics (i.e., estimator, number of indicators, number and distribution of response options, loading magnitude, sample size, and factor correlation). We included all characteristics identified as influential in previous studies. Our simulation enabled us to replicate well-known influences on GOFs and establish hitherto unknown or underappreciated ones. In particular, the magnitude of the factor correlation turned out to moderate the effects of several characteristics on GOFs. Second, to address these problems, we discuss several strategies for assessing model fit that take the dependency of GOFs on the modeling context into account.

It will explain how the perspectives taken in the following parts and individual chapters tie together to form a picture of transformation processes in Germany. Second, this chapter serves as a methodological guide through different statistical approaches that may be used to analyze societal and individual changes over time by pointing out common pitfalls of study designs and methods used in transformation research.

Antisemitism in East and W est Germany: Three decades after the wall: a comparative longitudinal study considering age-period-cohort effects,"{Since the unification of the two German states in 1990, antisemitic attitudes have been repeatedly polled in cross-sectional or longitudinal national surveys (e.g., the long-term GFE surveys). So far, comparative studies analyzing the development of antisemitism in East and West Germany over a longer time period are scarce. The study covers a time span of 30 years to investigate two forms of antisemitism (classical and secondary), especially with respect to inner-German differences. Applying model-based age-period-cohort analyses (APC) with a total of 19 available representative surveys (maximal period: 1991-2021), theory-driven hypotheses are tested. The statistical approach and respective findings are discussed with emphasis on several challenges accompanying the utilized heterogenous data and different survey modes. Findings reveal that life-cycle effects play a decisive role in the attitudinal development and distribution of antisemitic attitudes. Moreover, approval of antisemitism is to some extent cohort related in both East and West Germany, while disentangling period effects empirically poses challenges due to data limitations. Furthermore, the observed APC structures differ for classical and secondary antisemitism.

Beyond Facts: 4th International Workshop on Computational Methods for Online Discourse Analysis,"{Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts (events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. Computational methods, mostly from the field of NLP, have emerged that tackle a wide range of tasks in this context, including argument and opinion mining, claim detection, checkworthiness detection, stance detection or fact verification. However, computational models require robust definitions of classes and concepts under investigation. Thus, these computational tasks require a strong interdisciplinary and epistemological foundation, specifically with respect to the underlying definitions of key concepts such as claims, arguments, stances, check-worthiness or veracity. This requires a highly interdisciplinary approach combining expertise from fields such as communication studies, computational linguistics and computer science. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across communities. From a computational perspective, in order to address this complexity, the synergy of multiple approaches, coming both from symbolic (knowledge representation) and statistical AI seem to be promising to tackle such challenges. This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the analysis of societal debates on the Web.

Partnership Dynamics of LGB People and Heterosexuals: Patterns of First Partnership Formation and First Cohabitation,"{In this study we examine partnership dynamics among people with different sexual orientations in Germany. More specifically, we explore the process of first partnership formation and first cohabitation among men and women who self-identify as heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual. Given the various discriminations against same-sex lifestyles, and the limited opportunities to meet potential partners, we assume that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people form partnerships later in life and less frequently than heterosexuals. We further expect that the constantly improving social and legal climate for sexual minorities will lead to a reduction in differences in partnership behaviour by sexual orientation. We use retrospectively reported partnership biographies from the German Socio-Economic Panel, which was supplemented in 2019 with a boost sample of sexual and gender minority households. Using discrete-time event history models, we analyse nearly 15,000 episodes of being single and nearly 20,000 episodes of living without a partner in the household. Around 4.5% of these episodes are from people who self-identify as LGB. The results clearly show that patterns of partnership and coresidential union formation differ by sexual orientation. People with a homosexual orientation—and to a lesser extent people with a bisexual orientation—are less likely to enter into a first partnership and a first cohabitation than people with a heterosexual orientation. Significant changes occur across cohorts: LGB people from younger birth cohorts enter (cohabiting) partnerships much earlier and more frequently than those from older cohorts.

Careless whisper: Political elite discourses activate national identities for far-right voting preferences,"{While exclusionary national identities are widespread among Europeans, relatively few people vote for the far right in most countries. Thus, an exclusionary identity in many cases does not lead to voting for the most nativist types of parties.

Assessing Data Quality in the Age of Digital Social Research: A Systematic Review,"{While survey data has long been the focus of quantitative social science analyses, observational and content data, although long-established, are gaining renewed attention; especially when this type of data is obtained by and for observing digital content and behavior.

The simulation-cum-ROC approach: A new approach to generate tailored cutoffs for fit indices through simulation and ROC analysis,"{To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥.950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest.

How Relevant is NIMBYism to Citizens’ Support for the Large-Scale Deployment of Public Goods? Experimental Evidence from 5G Antenna Placement in Switzerland,"{Supplying society-wide public goods often depends on site-specific provision. Yet, (perceived) localized provision costs may at times outweigh localized individual benefits and thus lead to “not-in-my-backyard” (NIMBY-)opposition (e.g., when trying to set up energy, transportation, social, or, in our case, communication infrastructure). Accurate estimation of the level of NIMBY-opposition per se is analytically challenging because general attitudes towards provision and NIMBY-motivated opposition are intertwined but need to be distinguished and because site selection can be endogenous to local support/opposition. We conducted an experiment that addresses these challenges, focusing on public attitudes toward 5G antenna placement in Switzerland. Using original data from a population-representative sample of Swiss residents (), we observe a population split on the question of 5G network expansion. We survey-experimentally revealed actual 5G antenna locations around respondent homes to a sample largely unaware of these locations beforehand. This information increased individuals’ worry over proximity to antenna sites and reduced support for 5G rollout, with such effects becoming stronger with closer proximity. Differentiating respondents with ex ante higher perceived costs/lower perceived benefits and lower costs/higher benefits from provision, the former are more opposed to 5G rollout, regardless of distance. In contrast, the latter exhibit particularly pronounced NIMBY attitudes. This allows for unexpected political coalitions that, in our case, could affect majority support.

Forecasting Referendums: A Structural Model Predicting Adoption and Support in Irish Plebiscites 1968–2024,"{Election prediction flourishes among pollsters, the media, academics, and political anoraks, with four significant prognostic paradigms: opinion polls, markets, structural models, and hybrid approaches. Structural models, inspired by political science theory and based on so‐called “fundamental” indicators, have a long pedigree in predicting government performance in elections cross‐nationally. Despite their prevalence and prowess in forecasting contests for government, these structural models have not been applied to predict referendums, where the prognosis game, as far as it exists, primarily relies on polls. Perhaps this is unsurprising given that plebiscites can be especially hard to forecast given that citizens often vote on complex subjects not always salient in public discourse, partisan cues are sometimes lacking, and late opinion shifts are arguably more common than in elections. In this contribution, we break new ground by fusing two strands of political science literature—election forecasting and referendums—and devise a prediction model of plebiscites based on economic, institutional, and historical variables, thereby providing the first structural forecasting model to account for referendum adoption and support levels. We apply this model ex‐post to 42 national referendums in Ireland between 1968 and 2024 to test its applicability ex‐ante. In Europe, Ireland stands third only to Switzerland and Italy as polities that regularly employ referendums to decide public policy issues. With reasonable lead time, ex‐post estimates of our model offer solid predictions of the referendums’ outcome, with out‐of‐sample estimates calling the outcome correctly 68%–79% of the time, a remarkable feat given that the issues up for decision are varied. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model’s predictions are competitive with opinion poll estimates of these contests, illustrating that while our model is not a panacea, it provides a reasonable starting point for predicting the outcomes of referendums in Ireland and, importantly, plants a vital seed for future work on forecasting plebiscites using model approaches.}",2025,Politics and Governance,"{forecasting,ireland,referendums,structural models}",Sociology and Political Science,Social Sciences,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2025,"forecasting referendums: a structural model predicting adoption and support in irish plebiscites 1968–2024 {election prediction flourishes among pollsters, the media, academics, and political anoraks, with four significant prognostic paradigms: opinion polls, markets, structural models, and hybrid approaches. structural models, inspired by political science theory and based on so‐called “fundamental” indicators, have a long pedigree in predicting government performance in elections cross‐nationally. despite their prevalence and prowess in forecasting contests for government, these structural models have not been applied to predict referendums, where the prognosis game, as far as it exists, primarily relies on polls. perhaps this is unsurprising given that plebiscites can be especially hard to forecast given that citizens often vote on complex subjects not always salient in public discourse, partisan cues are sometimes lacking, and late opinion shifts are arguably more common than in elections. in this contribution, we break new ground by fusing two strands of political science literature—election forecasting and referendums—and devise a prediction model of plebiscites based on economic, institutional, and historical variables, thereby providing the first structural forecasting model to account for referendum adoption and support levels. we apply this model ex‐post to 42 national referendums in ireland between 1968 and 2024 to test its applicability ex‐ante. in europe, ireland stands third only to switzerland and italy as polities that regularly employ referendums to decide public policy issues. with reasonable lead time, ex‐post estimates of our model offer solid predictions of the referendums’ outcome, with out‐of‐sample estimates calling the outcome correctly 68%–79% of the time, a remarkable feat given that the issues up for decision are varied. moreover, we demonstrate that our model’s predictions are competitive with opinion poll estimates of these contests, illustrating that while our model is not a panacea, it provides a reasonable starting point for predicting the outcomes of referendums in ireland and, importantly, plants a vital seed for future work on forecasting plebiscites using model approaches.} {forecasting,ireland,referendums,structural models} {forecasting,ireland,referendums,structural models}",0,0.13445847693565752,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election"

The educational wealth divide in Europe: Post-secondary enrollment gaps across parental wealth components and countries,"{Parental wealth is a crucial dimension of socioeconomic status (SES) and plays a significant role in the intergenerational transmission of educational advantage. Previous research on the topic has been limited to a small number of countries, and findings on the relationship between parental wealth and educational attainment are hardly comparable across institutional contexts. Furthermore, the specific role of different wealth components remains unclear. This study addresses these gaps by comparing parental wealth-based inequalities in post-secondary enrollment across 15 European countries, using harmonized Household Finance and Consumption Survey data. We assess how different dimensions of parental wealth – net, real, and financial – relate to children's post-secondary enrollment, and how these associations vary across institutional contexts. Our findings reveal substantial enrollment gaps between high- and low-wealth families in all countries, with these disparities remaining significant in ten countries even after accounting for other parental SES dimensions. When considering net wealth, we observe the largest enrollment gaps in Southern and Eastern Europe and smaller gaps in most Continental countries. However, most of country differences are not statistically significant. Real wealth, particularly housing assets, is the strongest predictor of enrollment, whereas the role of household debt is more context-dependent.

Family Integration and Social Contacts of People from Syria and Eritrea in Germany,"{To date, there has been little research on the extent to which the family integration of new immigrants influences the development of social contacts with people from the host society. There is the possibility that immigrants are less dependent on social exchange with people from the host society as soon as close family members live in Germany with them. Empirical evidence to date does indeed point in this direction, but it rests on a rather narrow foundation. Therefore, using data from the project Forced Migration and Transnational Family Arrangements—Eritrean and Syrian Refugees in Germany (TransFAR), we investigate how the family situation of refugees from Syria or Eritrea living in Germany influences the number of their extra-familial contacts. In contrast to previous studies, we explicitly distinguish between the number of extra-familial intraethnic persons and the number of extra-familial persons originating from Germany. Theoretically, we assume that the benefits resulting from relationships with persons of their own ethnicity should differ from the benefits resulting from relationships with persons originating from Germany. As a consequence, relationships with Germans should hardly replace family contacts, whereas relationships with co-ethnics should more easily substitute for family contacts.

The simulation-cum-ROC approach: A new approach to generate tailored cutoffs for fit indices through simulation and ROC analysis,"{To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥.950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest.

"The Psychology of Attack Politics: Perceptions, Evaluations and Effects","{The Psychology of Attack Politics explores the use of political attacks in election campaigns, and the way in which their, often deliberate, use impacts voters and has wide reaching societal consequences. With most elections being fraught with tension, disrespectful treatment of political opponents, and political incivility, this timely book aims to disentangle the dynamics of how attack politics is perceived (e.g., whether citizens perceive a negative message to be, indeed, negative) and evaluated (i.e., whether citizens like or dislike attack politics). The book also looks at the effects of attack politics, for instance, whether exposure to negative or uncivil messages alters attitudes and behaviors, such as turnout, affective polarization, and support for political violence.

Capable but Not Empowered? How Emancipative Values Affect Protest Participation Across Different Contexts,"{Political protest and citizen participation are important drivers of democratic change.

Mapping modern kinship networks: First results from the KINMATRIX survey,"{Objective: This study presents initial results from the KINMATRIX survey, a large-scale source of ego-centric network data offering an unprecedented level of scope and detail in mapping family relationships.

As a result, key phenomena remain insufficiently understood, including the importance of extended kin, contrasts between kinship lines, and cross-national differences. Notably, extended kin provide a unique “strength in numbers” that can enhance social transmission, integration, and support. Method: We analyzed data from anchor respondents aged 25–35 (N = 11,788 anchors; 239,220 anchor-kin dyads) collected in seven Western countries (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States). Kinship networks included a large array of nuclear, extended, and complex kin (on average, 20 kin per anchor). We used descriptive methods to examine retrospective, current, and prospective assessments of kin ties across four measures: importance, closeness, contact, and support. Results: We report three main findings: First, extended kin are central to younger adults' lives, representing at least half of the family members they are emotionally close to, regularly contact, and deem important. Second, kinship networks are matrilineally tilted. Maternal kin are emotionally closer, more frequently contacted, considered more important, and more supportive.

From disruptive protests to disrupted news frames: Comparing German news on climate protests,"{This paper examines how news frames on disruptive climate protests differ from coverage of conventional protests in news outlets with different political leanings.

Comparing the more disruptive protests of the group “The Last Generation” and the more conventional protest movement “Fridays for Future”, we find that coverage of “Fridays for Future” varies predictably across the ideological spectrum: Right-wing outlets present protesters as extreme or criminal, while other outlets make reference to climate justice within their coverage of the protests, thereby following the movement’s own framing. When covering the more disruptive “Last Generation”, the entire news landscape engages in an emotionally-charged debate, asking whether the protesters are extremists or criminals, while barely discussing their actual demands.

Effects of Over-Time Exposure to Partisan Media and Coverage of Polarization on Perceived Polarization,"{America is said to be more polarized than ever before, and extensive research examines the causes and effects of political polarization. A less studied but more pronounced trend is that citizens perceive society and politics as sharply divided. We focus on news exposure as a key reason for these perceptions. We disentangle the unique effects of exposure to partisan outlets and to news coverage of polarization in general, whether in partisan or centrist news media. We rely on 9 months of online behavioral data (127,400,000 visits) from large samples in the U.S. and Poland (total N = 2,462 & 2,120), paired with a three-wave panel survey on participants' attitudes and perceptions. We measure individual exposure, over-time and unobtrusively, to partisan outlets as well as to news coverage of polarization through a fine-tuned BERT-based machine learning classifier. We find that both exposures increase perceived polarization, independently, in both countries. Yet, in both contexts, it is news coverage of polarization, regardless of whether it is ideologically left, right, or centrist news outlets, that is the strongest driver of perceived polarization. These changes are confined to personal-level polarization (perceived distance between oneself and members of the opposing party), while no measure significantly influences perceptions of society, more generally, as being polarized.

"Conceptualizing, Assessing, and Improving the Quality of Digital Behavioral Data","{The spread of modern digital technologies, such as social media online platforms, digital marketplaces, smartphones, and wearables, is increasingly shifting social, political, economic, cultural, and physiological processes into the digital space.

Using Live Video Interviews for Difficult Questionnaires on Social Networks,"{Collecting survey data via live video interviewing is a relatively new methodology, which received increased attention during the COVID-19 pandemic when contact restrictions and ethical considerations rendered face-to-face interviewing unfeasible. While many surveys switched from face-to-face interviews to online self-administration, this approach was unsuitable for complex questionnaires requiring interviewer assistance to guide respondents through the answering process. Our study focuses on the collection of egocentric social network data as an example of such a challenging questionnaire.

Scoring German Alternate Uses Items Applying Large Language Models,"{The alternate uses task (AUT) is the most popular measure when it comes to the assessment of creative potential. Since their implementation, AUT responses have been rated by humans, which is a laborious task and requires considerable resources. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in automatically scoring AUT responses in English as well as in other languages, but it is not clear which method works best for German data. Therefore, we investigated the performance of different LLMs for the automated scoring of German AUT responses. We compiled German data across five research groups including ~50,000 responses for 15 different alternate uses objects from eight lab and online survey studies (including ~2300 participants) to examine generalizability across datasets and assessment conditions.

"To share or not to share–understanding individuals’ willingness to share biomarkers, sensor data, and medical records","{Technological advances in the recent past made it possible for researchers to collect and analyze large amounts of health data at unprecedented scale and speed.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that access to such data for health research and evidence-based public policy decision-making is essential. However, having access to data depends on individuals’ willingness to share their data with others. In this paper, we analyze the factors that may affect the probability of individuals to share their biomarker, health, and sensor data using German survey data and a survey experimental vignette design.

"Inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills: Differences across social categories and their intersections","{This paper explores inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills. We examine whether skills vary by gender, parental education, immigrant background, school track—and their intersections. In two samples of German adolescents (age 14–20y; N = 3162), we fielded the Behavioral, Emotional, and Self-Regulatory Skills Inventory (BESSI), enabling a fine-grained assessment of 32 skill facets from five domains. Analyses revealed skill advantages for youth whose parents completed academic education and youth without immigrant background across most skills. Gender and school track had more varied effects mostly in favor of girls and adolescents attending academic tracks. Inequalities tended to be most pronounced for Innovation Skills. Intersectional analyses suggested that skill inequalities across intersectional strata (i.e., combinations of social categories) arose primarily from main effects of social categories, rather than intersectional interactions. We conclude that inequalities in SEB skills are small but systematic and unfold primarily as main effects. Educational relevance and implications: Our research explored whether adolescents differ in their levels of social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills depending on their gender, immigrant background, parents' education, and school track. We found that parents' education and immigrant background were the factors generating most consistent inequalities in SEB skills, with skill advantages for adolescents whose parents completed academic education and autochthonous adolescents across all skill domains and most skill facets, especially in Innovation Skills (e.g., information processing, creative skill, abstract thinking skill). Gender differences and, to a lesser extent, differences by school track were also present but more varied in terms of which subgroup showed skill advantages: On most skills, girls showed skill advantages over boys (with the exception of Emotional Resilience), as did and adolescents attending an academic school track over those attending a vocational track.

Our findings constitute a step towards helping educators, policymakers, and researchers identify groups of adolescents who are at a heightened need of support in developing SEB skills.

Message order matters: A robust author profiling approach for social media platforms,"{As the order of sentences can impact the meaning of texts, transformer models and recurrent neural networks (RNN) also consider the order of the tokens.

We first draw attention to the transformer models’ input limit and propose a message selection method that also reduces noise caused by irrelevant messages. In addition, we show that arbitrarily concatenating messages can be problematic. Therefore, we propose creating multiple variants of data by shuffling messages, classifying each variant separately, and then aggregating the predictions. In our comprehensive experiments, we focus on age, gender, occupation, and bot detection tasks. We show that the proposed content selection and shuffling-based methods lead to slight improvements in the transformer model's performance for age and gender detection tasks.

Facilitating the recall of biographical data: Alternatives to life history calendars,"{Reporting life course data is challenging for survey respondents since they need to search their memory for information.

To investigate which aspects of life history calendars that are both easy to implement for survey practitioners and easy to utilize for respondents have the potential to enhance the quality of life course data and are perceived as beneficial by respondents, I conducted a short web survey consisting of two waves conducted three months apart covering the respondents' occupational trajectory over the last two years.

CASMIN Versus ISCED: Validating Standard Education Variables for German Microdata,"{In German surveys, educational attainment is typically assessed through two questionnaire items: the highest general school-leaving qualification and the highest vocational qualification or higher education degree.

Many survey datasets offer a derived ISCED variable that reflects the main ISCED levels; fewer offer CASMIN.

Candidate standard education variables that retain a higher relative partial explanatory power across validation variables in linear multiple regression models compared to the most detailed education variable are considered more valid.

The Unseen Targets of Hate: A Systematic Review of Hateful Communication Datasets,"{Machine learning (ML)-based content moderation tools are essential to keep online spaces free from hateful communication. Yet ML tools can only be as capable as the quality of the data they are trained on allows them. While there is increasing evidence that they underperform in detecting hateful communications directed towards specific identities and may discriminate against them, we know surprisingly little about the provenance of such bias.

"The surge in living alone among young and middle-aged adults: A decomposition analysis of the rise in one-person households in Germany, 1991 to 2021","{BACKGROUND Worldwide, the number of people living in a one-person household (OPH) is rising, and young and middle-aged adults play an essential role in this trend. Germany has one of Europe’s highest rates of OPHs. Due to the country’s unique sociohistorical background, this paper looks at a 30-year period to examine how the increase in OPHs among 20–54-year-old men and women has developed since German reunification. METHODS We use data from the German Microcensus from 1991 to 2021 to calculate the annual share of individuals living in an OPH. Following an algebraic decomposition approach proposed by Evelyn Kitagawa and adapted by Glenn Firebaugh, we split the sample into 13 5-year birth cohorts to examine the effects of within-cohort change and cohort replacement in the rising share of OPHs. RESULTS After German reunification, the increase in OPHs was first driven by within-cohort change, most likely caused by different mechanisms in East and West Germany. Since the mid to late 2000s, cohort replacement has become the main force behind the increase in OPHs. West German women deviate from this in showing only a moderate rise in OPHs almost entirely driven by cohort replacement throughout the 30 years analysed here. CONTRIBUTION Considering East–West and gender differences extends our knowledge of how structural factors add to the increase in OPHs. Living alone is not merely the result of individual choices but also of sociohistorical circumstances.

The level and development of university students’ social integration: personality traits and person-environment fit predict integration with fellow students and teaching staff,"{The transition from secondary to higher education can be challenging for students. They have to adjust academically and must integrate into a new social environment. Successful social integration is important for university students’ academic success and well-being.

In this study, we investigate how students’ Big Five personality traits influence the level and development of their social integration.

Forecasting Referendums: A Structural Model Predicting Adoption and Support in Irish Plebiscites 1968–2024,"{Election prediction flourishes among pollsters, the media, academics, and political anoraks, with four significant prognostic paradigms: opinion polls, markets, structural models, and hybrid approaches. Structural models, inspired by political science theory and based on so‐called “fundamental” indicators, have a long pedigree in predicting government performance in elections cross‐nationally. Despite their prevalence and prowess in forecasting contests for government, these structural models have not been applied to predict referendums, where the prognosis game, as far as it exists, primarily relies on polls. Perhaps this is unsurprising given that plebiscites can be especially hard to forecast given that citizens often vote on complex subjects not always salient in public discourse, partisan cues are sometimes lacking, and late opinion shifts are arguably more common than in elections. In this contribution, we break new ground by fusing two strands of political science literature—election forecasting and referendums—and devise a prediction model of plebiscites based on economic, institutional, and historical variables, thereby providing the first structural forecasting model to account for referendum adoption and support levels. We apply this model ex‐post to 42 national referendums in Ireland between 1968 and 2024 to test its applicability ex‐ante. In Europe, Ireland stands third only to Switzerland and Italy as polities that regularly employ referendums to decide public policy issues. With reasonable lead time, ex‐post estimates of our model offer solid predictions of the referendums’ outcome, with out‐of‐sample estimates calling the outcome correctly 68%–79% of the time, a remarkable feat given that the issues up for decision are varied. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model’s predictions are competitive with opinion poll estimates of these contests, illustrating that while our model is not a panacea, it provides a reasonable starting point for predicting the outcomes of referendums in Ireland and, importantly, plants a vital seed for future work on forecasting plebiscites using model approaches.}",2025,Politics and Governance,"{forecasting,ireland,referendums,structural models}",Public Administration,Social Sciences,Social Sciences & Humanities,SS,2025,"forecasting referendums: a structural model predicting adoption and support in irish plebiscites 1968–2024 {election prediction flourishes among pollsters, the media, academics, and political anoraks, with four significant prognostic paradigms: opinion polls, markets, structural models, and hybrid approaches. structural models, inspired by political science theory and based on so‐called “fundamental” indicators, have a long pedigree in predicting government performance in elections cross‐nationally. despite their prevalence and prowess in forecasting contests for government, these structural models have not been applied to predict referendums, where the prognosis game, as far as it exists, primarily relies on polls. perhaps this is unsurprising given that plebiscites can be especially hard to forecast given that citizens often vote on complex subjects not always salient in public discourse, partisan cues are sometimes lacking, and late opinion shifts are arguably more common than in elections. in this contribution, we break new ground by fusing two strands of political science literature—election forecasting and referendums—and devise a prediction model of plebiscites based on economic, institutional, and historical variables, thereby providing the first structural forecasting model to account for referendum adoption and support levels. we apply this model ex‐post to 42 national referendums in ireland between 1968 and 2024 to test its applicability ex‐ante. in europe, ireland stands third only to switzerland and italy as polities that regularly employ referendums to decide public policy issues. with reasonable lead time, ex‐post estimates of our model offer solid predictions of the referendums’ outcome, with out‐of‐sample estimates calling the outcome correctly 68%–79% of the time, a remarkable feat given that the issues up for decision are varied. moreover, we demonstrate that our model’s predictions are competitive with opinion poll estimates of these contests, illustrating that while our model is not a panacea, it provides a reasonable starting point for predicting the outcomes of referendums in ireland and, importantly, plants a vital seed for future work on forecasting plebiscites using model approaches.} {forecasting,ireland,referendums,structural models} {forecasting,ireland,referendums,structural models}",0,0.13377551658777023,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election"

Creating Design Weights for a Panel Survey With Multiple Refreshment Samples: A General Discussion With an Application to a Probability-Based Mixed-Mode Panel,"{Panel surveys suffer from attrition, where participants drop out over time. To maintain generalizability, refreshment samples are frequently employed, bringing in new individuals, increasing the number of panelists, and balancing sample composition.

If not correctly accounted for, their inclusion may bias results. This paper addresses the issue of designing proper weights by applying the multiple-frame weighting approach proposed by Kalton and Anderson, which is generally used for cross-sectional surveys, to ongoing panel studies with refreshment samples.

"The Psychology of Attack Politics: Perceptions, Evaluations and Effects","{The Psychology of Attack Politics explores the use of political attacks in election campaigns, and the way in which their, often deliberate, use impacts voters and has wide reaching societal consequences. With most elections being fraught with tension, disrespectful treatment of political opponents, and political incivility, this timely book aims to disentangle the dynamics of how attack politics is perceived (e.g., whether citizens perceive a negative message to be, indeed, negative) and evaluated (i.e., whether citizens like or dislike attack politics). The book also looks at the effects of attack politics, for instance, whether exposure to negative or uncivil messages alters attitudes and behaviors, such as turnout, affective polarization, and support for political violence. The authors provide a systematic conceptualization of attack politics, made up of negativity, incivility, and intolerance. Focusing on cutting- edge research in political psychology, political communication, and electoral behavior, the authors make the central argument that to understand the effects of different forms of attack politics, there should be a strong focus on individual differences in message perception and evaluation.

However, because of their cost advantages, nonprobability surveys are widely used, and there is much debate over the appropriate settings for their use. To contribute to this debate, we evaluate the accuracy of nonprobability surveys by investigating the common claim that estimates of relationships are more robust to sample bias than means or proportions. We compare demographic, attitudinal, and behavioral variables across eight German probability and nonprobability surveys with demographic and political benchmarks from the microcensus and a high-quality, face-to-face survey. In the analyses, we compare three types of statistical inference: univariate estimates, bivariate Pearson’s r coefficients, and 24 different multiple regression models. The results indicate that in univariate comparisons, nonprobability surveys were clearly less accurate than probability surveys when compared with the population benchmarks. These differences in accuracy were smaller in the bivariate and the multivariate comparisons across surveys.

"Inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills: Differences across social categories and their intersections","{This paper explores inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills. We examine whether skills vary by gender, parental education, immigrant background, school track—and their intersections. In two samples of German adolescents (age 14–20y; N = 3162), we fielded the Behavioral, Emotional, and Self-Regulatory Skills Inventory (BESSI), enabling a fine-grained assessment of 32 skill facets from five domains. Analyses revealed skill advantages for youth whose parents completed academic education and youth without immigrant background across most skills. Gender and school track had more varied effects mostly in favor of girls and adolescents attending academic tracks. Inequalities tended to be most pronounced for Innovation Skills. Intersectional analyses suggested that skill inequalities across intersectional strata (i.e., combinations of social categories) arose primarily from main effects of social categories, rather than intersectional interactions. We conclude that inequalities in SEB skills are small but systematic and unfold primarily as main effects. Educational relevance and implications: Our research explored whether adolescents differ in their levels of social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills depending on their gender, immigrant background, parents' education, and school track. We found that parents' education and immigrant background were the factors generating most consistent inequalities in SEB skills, with skill advantages for adolescents whose parents completed academic education and autochthonous adolescents across all skill domains and most skill facets, especially in Innovation Skills (e.g., information processing, creative skill, abstract thinking skill). Gender differences and, to a lesser extent, differences by school track were also present but more varied in terms of which subgroup showed skill advantages: On most skills, girls showed skill advantages over boys (with the exception of Emotional Resilience), as did and adolescents attending an academic school track over those attending a vocational track. We further established that inequalities in SEB skills mainly arise from the simple effects of the social categories, rather than through complex interactions among their intersections. Our findings constitute a step towards helping educators, policymakers, and researchers identify groups of adolescents who are at a heightened need of support in developing SEB skills.

This new data type, which we refer to as “digital behavioral data” (DBD), encompasses digital observations of human and algorithmic behavior, which are, amongst others, recorded by online platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, or the World Wide Web) or sensors (e.g., smartphones, RFID sensors, satellites, or street view cameras). However, studying these social phenomena requires data that meets specific quality standards. While data quality frameworks—such as the Total Survey Error framework—have a long-standing tradition survey research, the scientific use of DBD introduces several entirely new challenges related to data quality. For example, most DBD are not generated for research purposes but are a side product of our daily activities. Hence, the data generation process is not based on elaborate research designs, which in turn may have profound implications for the validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of DBD. Furthermore, many forms of DBD lack well-established data models, measurement (error) theories, quality standards, and evaluation criteria. Therefore, this special issue addresses (i) the conceptualization of DBD quality, methodological innovations for its (ii) assessment, and (iii) improvement as well as their sophisticated empirical application.}",2025,Social Science Computer Review,"{data quality,designed data,digital behavioral data,error framework,found data}",Computer Science Applications,Computer Science,Physical Sciences,SS,2025,"conceptualizing, assessing, and improving the quality of digital behavioral data {the spread of modern digital technologies, such as social media online platforms, digital marketplaces, smartphones, and wearables, is increasingly shifting social, political, economic, cultural, and physiological processes into the digital space. social actors using these technologies (directly and indirectly) leave a multitude of digital traces in many areas of life that sum up an enormous amount of data about human behavior and attitudes. this new data type, which we refer to as “digital behavioral data” (dbd), encompasses digital observations of human and algorithmic behavior, which are, amongst others, recorded by online platforms (e.g., google, facebook, or the world wide web) or sensors (e.g., smartphones, rfid sensors, satellites, or street view cameras). however, studying these social phenomena requires data that meets specific quality standards. while data quality frameworks—such as the total survey error framework—have a long-standing tradition survey research, the scientific use of dbd introduces several entirely new challenges related to data quality. for example, most dbd are not generated for research purposes but are a side product of our daily activities. hence, the data generation process is not based on elaborate research designs, which in turn may have profound implications for the validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of dbd. furthermore, many forms of dbd lack well-established data models, measurement (error) theories, quality standards, and evaluation criteria. therefore, this special issue addresses (i) the conceptualization of dbd quality, methodological innovations for its (ii) assessment, and (iii) improvement as well as their sophisticated empirical application.} {data quality,designed data,digital behavioral data,error framework,found data} {data quality,designed data,digital behavioral data,error framework,found data}",12,1.0,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error"
A Comparative Evaluation of Quantification Methods,"{Quantification represents the problem of estimating the distribution of class labels on unseen data. It also represents a growing research field in supervised machine learning, for which a large variety of different algorithms has been proposed in recent years.

In this work, we close this research gap by conducting a thorough empirical performance comparison of 24 different quantification methods on in total more than 40 datasets, considering binary as well as multiclass quantification settings. We observe that no single algorithm generally outperforms all competitors, but identify a group of methods that perform best in the binary setting, including the threshold selection-based median sweep and TSMax methods, the DyS framework including the HDy method, Forman’s mixture model, and Friedman’s method. For the multiclass setting, we observe that a different, broad group of algorithms yields good performance, including the HDx method, the generalized probabilistic adjusted count, the readme method, the energy distance minimization method, the EM algorithm for quantification, and Friedman’s method. We also find that tuning the underlying classifiers has in most cases only a limited impact on the quantification performance.

A Political History Forecast of Bloc Support in the 2025 German Federal Election,"{“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” said humorist and social critic Mark Twain. Simply put, history often follows recurring cycles, enabling us to identify patterns that will likely repeat. Such supposed steadiness should bode well for prediction. Nevertheless, regarding structural election forecasts, most projections rely on short-term political fundamentals measuring macroeconomic performance or government or leader popularity. In this contribution, we take a structural approach but eschew any macroeconomic or popularity measure and instead rely on historical and structural patterns to predict the 2025 German Federal Election. Using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR), our model predicts the vote share of Germany’s two largest blocs – the Union and the SPD – and All Others combined across 19 elections between 1953 and 2021 with solid accuracy (correctly predicting the winning bloc 3 out of 4 times), creating circumstances to assume Political History may be a helpful guide as to how the 2025 contest may pan out. Our ex-ante central projection for the 2025 German federal election foresees a cliffhanger race, with point estimates suggesting the Union and the SPD will win 26% of the vote each and All Others 48%, departing from the dominant narrative of the opinion polls of a clear CDU/CSU plurality vote victory and substantial losses for the SPD.

Good enough? A comparison of different harmonization procedures and their substantive consequences using the example of life satisfaction,"{Survey data harmonization can greatly improve the analytical potentials of survey data by making divergent measurements of the same construct comparable. While there may often be ideas on what is the optimal harmonization strategy (e.g. imputation or equipercentile equating), these approaches are not always feasible e.g. due to data-based restrictions or the lack of a suitable reference sample. Therefore, sometimes there is only a set of second-best strategies, such as linear equating or linear stretching, with no clear idea which of these should be given preference. The present paper takes this situation as a starting point and investigates the substantive consequences of different alternatives for a typical harmonization scenario using real-world survey data. Divergent substantive consequences are understood as differences in obtained analytical result patterns. Do the actual scientific conclusions differ when different harmonization approaches are employed? Results based on a variety of regression scenarios indicate that most substantive conclusions are obtained regardless of the harmonization approach chosen, but that harmonization procedures entailing an information loss due to recoding variables into smaller sets of categories should be avoided.

When do candidates “go negative”? A conjoint analysis to unpack the mechanisms of negative campaigning,"{Negative campaigning has become a prevalent campaign strategy not just in the U.S., but also in other established democracies. While negative campaigning has been a prominent focus of the academic literature, the state of knowledge is still mostly based on observational data, often artifacts of campaigning such as content analysis of press releases, campaign ads, or social media posts. Based on a pre-registered conjoint experiment embedded in surveys of more than 800 candidates running in German state elections, the paper aims to explain under what conditions candidates attack their opponents. Rational-choice considerations matter, as candidates are more likely to attack when they see a net gain in the strategy. However, the characteristics and behavior of the opponent also play an important role. Negative campaigning is more likely if the opponent is male, ideologically distant, and has attacked before. In contrast, the closeness of the race and the likelihood of retaliation have no influence on attack behavior. Furthermore, the decision to attack their opponent is largely independent of candidates’ own incumbency status, gender, or personality. By integrating relevant factors that were identified in the literature in one research design, the paper sheds light on the drivers of campaign negativity and points towards the role of further situational factors that are shaping candidates' behavior on the campaign trail.

"The Psychology of Attack Politics: Perceptions, Evaluations and Effects","{The Psychology of Attack Politics explores the use of political attacks in election campaigns, and the way in which their, often deliberate, use impacts voters and has wide reaching societal consequences. With most elections being fraught with tension, disrespectful treatment of political opponents, and political incivility, this timely book aims to disentangle the dynamics of how attack politics is perceived (e.g., whether citizens perceive a negative message to be, indeed, negative) and evaluated (i.e., whether citizens like or dislike attack politics).

It is strong across countries, weaker for the urban-rural divide, and minimal at the core-periphery level.

Gender Equality Plans and Inclusiveness in the European Research Area,"{Gender equality is a key objective of the European Research Area. The arsenal of gender equality concepts has expanded considerably over the past decades—from gender mainstreaming in the 1990s to the current inclusion, diversity, and intersectionality approaches.

With the launch of Horizon Europe, the European Union’s research and innovation program 2021–2027, the European Commission introduced a new eligibility criterion: To be eligible, any research‐performing organization (RPO) applying for funding, except private companies, must have a GEP in place. There is little evidence on the prevalence of GEPs at RPOs, and if they incorporate concepts about inclusiveness, which is increasingly intended. To address this knowledge gap, we present the first results of a unique mixed‐method study that combines online survey data (N = 270) and web‐scraping data (N = 6,475).

"Conceptualizing, Assessing, and Improving the Quality of Digital Behavioral Data","{The spread of modern digital technologies, such as social media online platforms, digital marketplaces, smartphones, and wearables, is increasingly shifting social, political, economic, cultural, and physiological processes into the digital space. Social actors using these technologies (directly and indirectly) leave a multitude of digital traces in many areas of life that sum up an enormous amount of data about human behavior and attitudes. This new data type, which we refer to as “digital behavioral data” (DBD), encompasses digital observations of human and algorithmic behavior, which are, amongst others, recorded by online platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, or the World Wide Web) or sensors (e.g., smartphones, RFID sensors, satellites, or street view cameras). However, studying these social phenomena requires data that meets specific quality standards. While data quality frameworks—such as the Total Survey Error framework—have a long-standing tradition survey research, the scientific use of DBD introduces several entirely new challenges related to data quality. For example, most DBD are not generated for research purposes but are a side product of our daily activities. Hence, the data generation process is not based on elaborate research designs, which in turn may have profound implications for the validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of DBD.

One harmonization fits all?–Impact of missing population invariance on harmonization error when harmonizing social science survey questions with equating,"{When combining survey data from different sources, researchers face the problem that questions measuring the same construct often differ in their response scales across surveys, making data difficult to compare. In this situation, observed score equating in a random groups design (OSE-RG) can transform the data of one question into the format of another question, making the data comparable. However, OSE-RG transformations are population dependent. An OSE-RG transformation established in one population might not be applicable to other (sub-)populations. This leads to the problem that practitioners accidentally can introduce bias into subsequent analysis depending on how they harmonize and analyze their data. In this study, we empirically investigate this source of bias, termed (missing) population invariance of OSE-RG.

Response Burden and Response Quality in Web Probing. An Experiment on the Effects of Probe Placement and Format,"{Probes are follow-up questions to survey questions used for question pretesting and evaluation. A probe can be placed concurrently-that is directly following the survey question it relates to-or retrospectively later or at the end of a survey. Retrospective probing ensures that the natural flow of the survey questions is not interrupted. In contrast, concurrent probing is argued to prioritize the quality of probe responses, as respondents can still access their short-term memory. To date, concerns that retrospective probe placement negatively impacts how probes are perceived and answered have not been tested experimentally. Recently, it has been suggested to employ “closed” probes with predefined response options, for instance using a check-all-that-apply format, also with the rationale of improving probe response quality. Closed probe formats suffer from fewer nonresponse and more themes being chosen than being typed in response to open-ended probes. The present research reports a study on the impact of probe placement on response burden and response quality of web probes. Moreover, it examines whether the effects of probe placement are moderated by probe format. Results show that respondents needed longer to recapitulate the survey question when probes are asked retrospectively and were less likely to offer interpretable probe response content for one of three examined probes.

From denial to window dressing? Resistance to gender equality plans at technical universities and the role of formalized implementation structures,"{The implementation of gender equality plans (GEPs) at universities provokes resistance from privileged groups. However, technical universities (TUs) in the European Research Area (ERA) are increasingly committed to developing and implementing GEPs. This study asks how institutionalized forms of resistance to GEPs in TUs interact with contextual factors–specifically, the level of formalization of implementation structures. In our qualitative content analysis of interview data from change agents and decision-makers at four TUs in the ERA, we theorize that implementation structures are crucial contextual factors to structure our data and interpret our findings on forms of resistance. We find that some forms of resistance are unrelated to the level of formalization of implementation structures, others are more prevalent in TUs with low-formalized implementation structures, and still others are predominant in TUs with high-formalized implementation structures. Our findings suggest that although a high level of formalization of implementation structures in TUs is associated with less denial of the existence of gender inequalities, resistance to GEP implementation persists but is more nuanced. We demonstrate that the dynamics between the meaning of gender equality and resistance change with the level of formalization of implementation structures and conclude that these dynamics are reciprocal rather than one-directional.

Family Integration and Social Contacts of People from Syria and Eritrea in Germany,"{To date, there has been little research on the extent to which the family integration of new immigrants influences the development of social contacts with people from the host society. There is the possibility that immigrants are less dependent on social exchange with people from the host society as soon as close family members live in Germany with them. Empirical evidence to date does indeed point in this direction, but it rests on a rather narrow foundation. Therefore, using data from the project Forced Migration and Transnational Family Arrangements—Eritrean and Syrian Refugees in Germany (TransFAR), we investigate how the family situation of refugees from Syria or Eritrea living in Germany influences the number of their extra-familial contacts. In contrast to previous studies, we explicitly distinguish between the number of extra-familial intraethnic persons and the number of extra-familial persons originating from Germany. Theoretically, we assume that the benefits resulting from relationships with persons of their own ethnicity should differ from the benefits resulting from relationships with persons originating from Germany. As a consequence, relationships with Germans should hardly replace family contacts, whereas relationships with co-ethnics should more easily substitute for family contacts.

Explaining a temporal influence of national identity on political behavior, social-psychological theories argue that identities need to be activated to become behaviorally relevant.

Conflict and support during apprenticeship training in Germany: consequences for apprenticeship success and further employment in the company,"{Dual vocational training, i.e., the combination of on-the-job training in a company and school-based teaching, is of major importance to a smooth transition into the labor market and for the recruitment of skilled labor in Germany. However, around 30 percent of all training contracts are not successfully completed and not all successful apprentices remain in their training company afterwards. Previous studies have shown that apprentices who terminated their training prematurely often report conflicts and insufficient support within the company as reasons. However, these studies do not include the group of successful apprentices for whom these two aspects might also have been an issue. Moreover, to our knowledge, no study has yet appropriately investigated how conflicts and a lack of support are related to the likelihood of staying in the training company as an employee after training graduation. Using panel data from the Starting Cohort 4 of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS SC4), we address these research gaps. Our results indicate that apprentices are less likely to finish their training successfully when they report conflicts in the company and more likely when they report support. Support does not buffer the negative effects of conflicts. Successful trainees are only less likely to subsequently remain in the training company when they report high levels of conflicts combined with low levels of support.

Mapping modern kinship networks: First results from the KINMATRIX survey,"{Objective: This study presents initial results from the KINMATRIX survey, a large-scale source of ego-centric network data offering an unprecedented level of scope and detail in mapping family relationships. Background: Research on kinship networks is limited by the scarcity of available data. As a result, key phenomena remain insufficiently understood, including the importance of extended kin, contrasts between kinship lines, and cross-national differences. Notably, extended kin provide a unique “strength in numbers” that can enhance social transmission, integration, and support. Method: We analyzed data from anchor respondents aged 25–35 (N = 11,788 anchors; 239,220 anchor-kin dyads) collected in seven Western countries (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States). Kinship networks included a large array of nuclear, extended, and complex kin (on average, 20 kin per anchor). We used descriptive methods to examine retrospective, current, and prospective assessments of kin ties across four measures: importance, closeness, contact, and support. Results: We report three main findings: First, extended kin are central to younger adults' lives, representing at least half of the family members they are emotionally close to, regularly contact, and deem important. Second, kinship networks are matrilineally tilted. Maternal kin are emotionally closer, more frequently contacted, considered more important, and more supportive. Third, cross-national comparisons reveal both similarities and notable differences, with the United States and Sweden showing elevated importance of extended and complex kin and Italy exhibiting higher social integration with nuclear and extended kin.

Intergenerational family life courses and wealth accumulation in Norway,"{While prior research has widely acknowledged the consequences of specific family transitions (e.g., parental death, parenthood, grandparenthood) for individual wealth holdings, the interplay of multiple family transitions and positions occurring at different life stages and in various orderings has received little attention. This is despite the fact that these transitions and positions most likely jointly shape wealth accumulation, both in the shorter and longer run. We apply (1) sequence analysis to identify typical family life course clusters defined by the timing of the death of the parent generation, the timing of the transition into parenthood, and grandparenthood and (2) regression analysis to describe how the accumulation of wealth between ages 40 and 64 differs by family life course cluster. Using Norwegian register data of individuals born in 1953 (N = 47,945), we identified six clusters of family trajectories ranging from childless individuals to individuals who were sandwiched between their parents, children, and grandchildren because of relatively early (grand)parenthood and late parental death. Individuals experiencing patterns with a later transition into (grand)parenthood occupied stable and high wealth positions over time. Individuals without children exhibited a steady increase in their wealth position. Additionally, experiencing parental death later in life was associated with increasing wealth, whereas early parental death was not. These results held net of gender and education.

The keys to the house - How wealth transfers stratify homeownership opportunities,"{This study investigates how actual and anticipated intergenerational wealth transfers – i.e., inter vivos gifts and inheritances – contribute to inequalities in the transition to homeownership by parental social class. Utilizing discrete-time survival analysis on data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (N = 13,018), we find that individuals whose parents were manual workers or service workers are less likely to become homeowners than those whose parents belonged to other social classes. Receiving inheritances or inter vivos gifts substantially increases the probability of homeownership, with the effect being most pronounced in the transfer year and diminishing rapidly thereafter. Anticipated future transfers also increase homeownership probability before transfer receipt. Together, anticipated and received transfers account for 15–54 % of the differences in homeownership transition rates by parental social class. Ignoring expected transfers leads to a significant underestimation of the role that wealth plays in shaping the relationship between parental class and homeownership.

Location matters! Geospatial dynamics of MP responses to Covid-19 protests in multilevel systems,"{In liberal democracies, protest can serve as a trigger for necessary policy reforms, but it can also be used by a loud minority to advance political goals against the will of the majority. Focusing on such vocal protests in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we investigate the following question: How does the location of protest events affect the likelihood of political engagement with the protests in a multilevel system? Combining social movement literature with studies of issue attention and rhetorical responsiveness, we analyze how German members of parliaments’ (MPs) responses vary using their tweets from the onset of the pandemic to the German federal election in September 2021. Using quantitative text analysis, we measure rhetorical responsiveness to Covid-19 protests and apply multilevel regression analyses and difference-in-differences.

Assessing Data Quality in the Age of Digital Social Research: A Systematic Review,"{While survey data has long been the focus of quantitative social science analyses, observational and content data, although long-established, are gaining renewed attention; especially when this type of data is obtained by and for observing digital content and behavior. Today, digital technologies allow social scientists to track “everyday behavior” and to extract opinions from public discussions on online platforms. These new types of digital traces of human behavior, together with computational methods for analyzing them, have opened new avenues for analyzing, understanding, and addressing social science research questions. However, even the most innovative and extensive amounts of data are hollow if they are not of high quality. But what does data quality mean for modern social science data? To investigate this rather abstract question the present study focuses on four objectives. First, we provide researchers with a decision tree to identify appropriate data quality frameworks for a given use case. Second, we determine which data types and quality dimensions are already addressed in the existing frameworks. Third, we identify gaps with respect to different data types and data quality dimensions within the existing frameworks which need to be filled.

An In-depth Analysis of the Linguistic Characteristics of Science Claims on the Web and their Impact on Fact-checking,"{Web claims, seen as assertions shared on the web and eligible for fact-checking, are at the heart of online discourse. They have been studied extensively on a variety of downstream tasks such as fact-checking, claim retrieval, bias detection, argument mining, or viewpoint discovery. On the other hand, claims originating from scientific publications have also been the subject of several downstream NLP tasks. However, research carried out so far has yet to focus on scientific web claims, which are scientific claims made on the web (e.g., on social media and news articles). The process of detecting and fact-checking a claim from the web can be very different depending on whether the claim is scientific or not, thus making it crucial for the developed datasets, methods, and models to make a distinction between the two. With this work, we aim at understanding what makes this distinction necessary, by understanding the linguistic differences between scientific and non-scientific claims on the web, and the impact those differences have on existing downstream tasks. To do so, we manually annotate 1,524 web claims from established benchmarks for fact-checking-related tasks, and we run statistical tests to analyze and compare the linguistic features of each group. We find that scientific claims on the web use more analytical speech, but also use more sentiment-related speech, more expressions of physical motion, and have distinct parts of speech (PoS) and punctuation styles. We also conduct experiments showing that BERT-based language models perform worse on scientific web claims by up to 17 F1 points for several downstream tasks. To understand why, we develop a novel methodology to map predictive tokens of language models to explainable linguistic features and find that language models fail to detect a specific subset of predictive features of scientific web claims.

Beyond age and generations: How considering period effects reshapes our understanding of personality change.,"{Age, cohort, and period effects are three ways to explain personality trait change over time. While past research mostly focused on age differences, showing relatively consistent patterns, evidence for cohort differences is more mixed, and period differences have hardly been examined. However, age, period, and cohort are exactly collinear (age = period—cohort), such that estimates are likely confounded and always hinge on so-called identification assumptions. Identification assumptions shape substantive conclusions, and inappropriate or inconsistent strategies may explain past discrepant findings. To address this age–period–cohort identification problem in personality change, we leveraged four large-scale (Ntotal > 2 Mio) repeated cross-sectional data sets from 2003 to 2022. Our aims were to demonstrate how identification assumptions common in personality studies impact estimates for age, cohort, and period and to use weaker, substantively informed assumptions to narrow down the range of plausible solutions. Results showed that common identification strategies of constraining one temporal effect to zero can dramatically affect conclusions—less for age-graded, but more for generational differences. Using weaker assumptions, our results indicated that all three factors—age, cohort, and period—likely contribute to trait differences over time. Assuming age-graded change in a certain direction revealed cohort-related decreases in extraversion, openness, and neuroticism and increases in agreeableness, alongside period-related increases in extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness. This suggests that several previously assumed cohort differences may actually be driven by period effects, overlooked due to strong identification assumptions. Overall, highlighting the importance of appropriate identification strategies, our results offer unique insights into factors driving trait differences over time.

The educational wealth divide in Europe: Post-secondary enrollment gaps across parental wealth components and countries,"{Parental wealth is a crucial dimension of socioeconomic status (SES) and plays a significant role in the intergenerational transmission of educational advantage. Previous research on the topic has been limited to a small number of countries, and findings on the relationship between parental wealth and educational attainment are hardly comparable across institutional contexts.

This study addresses these gaps by comparing parental wealth-based inequalities in post-secondary enrollment across 15 European countries, using harmonized Household Finance and Consumption Survey data. We assess how different dimensions of parental wealth – net, real, and financial – relate to children's post-secondary enrollment, and how these associations vary across institutional contexts.

Creating Design Weights for a Panel Survey With Multiple Refreshment Samples: A General Discussion With an Application to a Probability-Based Mixed-Mode Panel,"{Panel surveys suffer from attrition, where participants drop out over time.

The keys to the house - How wealth transfers stratify homeownership opportunities,"{This study investigates how actual and anticipated intergenerational wealth transfers – i.e., inter vivos gifts and inheritances – contribute to inequalities in the transition to homeownership by parental social class. Utilizing discrete-time survival analysis on data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (N = 13,018), we find that individuals whose parents were manual workers or service workers are less likely to become homeowners than those whose parents belonged to other social classes. Receiving inheritances or inter vivos gifts substantially increases the probability of homeownership, with the effect being most pronounced in the transfer year and diminishing rapidly thereafter. Anticipated future transfers also increase homeownership probability before transfer receipt.

Using Google Trends Data to Study High-Frequency Search Terms: Evidence for a Reliability-Frequency Continuum,"{Google Trends (GT) data are increasingly used in the social sciences and adjacent fields. However, previous research on the quality of GT data has raised concerns regarding their reliability. In the present study, we investigated whether reliability differs between low- and high-frequency search terms. In other words, we explored the existence of a reliability-frequency continuum in GT data. Our study adds to previous research by investigating a more comprehensive set of search terms and different aspects of reliability (e.g., differences in relative search volume distributions, correctly identified maxima). For this purpose, we collected samples of GT data for ten high- and two low-frequency search terms.

"You can't see what you don't measure! A scoping review of measurements of gender-based violence, its determinants and consequences in academia","{Introduction Assessing the problem of gender-based violence in academia internationally is challenging due to a lack of empirical evidence and differences in how it is measured. The contribution of this article is to reflect on survey measurements and to propose new avenues for future quantitative measurements of gender-based violence, its determinants, and consequences in an academic context. For this purpose, we present the results of a scoping review of ten national and cross-national prevalence studies on gender-based violence. We examined the studies’ quantitative operationalisation of (1) sex and gender, (2) prevalence of gender-based violence, (3) socio-demographic determinants from an intersectional perspective, individual and contextual factors, (4) and consequences. Materials and methods Prevalence studies were identified through a comprehensive search of electronic databases and specialised data repositories. The selection criteria included studies with a focus on gender-based violence, the use of closed-ended survey questions, i.e., in a questionnaire, the potential for applicability in different national contexts, and the specific context of higher education. Eligible sources also described the quantitative operationalisation of the survey measurements. Results Our work critically reviews previous efforts to measure gender-based violence, its determinants, and consequences in academic contexts. The findings of our assessment show, first, that quantitative gender-related measurements tend to conflate the concepts of sex and gender, and hence their operationalisation in quantitative surveys. Second, there is a strong emphasis on sexual harassment and sexual violence to the detriment of other relevant forms of violence, as well as a rooting of measurement concepts in locally valid but diverse legal definitions of gender-based violence. Third, there is a lack of socio-demographic determinants to provide an intersectional lens, as well as a focus on measurement frameworks that individualise the experiences of gender-based violence. This prevents a conceptualisation of harassment and abuse as a structural problem in the academic sector and ignores that violence is both as a cause and a consequence of unbalanced gendered power relations and inequalities in institutional and societal contexts. Fourth, there is generally a retrospective approach to measuring the consequences of gender-based violence, which may represent a source of potential bias. We reflect on how future survey instruments could address these issues in academic environments. Discussion Overall, our paper demonstrates how the evidence generated by different conceptualisations and operationalisations of gender-based violence in academia, as well as its determinants and consequences, shapes how we think and talk about the problem. In doing so, this article contributes to the ongoing methodological discussion on the measurement of gender-based violence and provides a rationale for improving its measurement framework in academic environments by taking a feminist-theory informed approach to collecting these data.}",2025,PLoS ONE,,Multidisciplinary,Multidisciplinary,Multidisciplinary,SS,2025,"you can't see what you don't measure! a scoping review of measurements of gender-based violence, its determinants and consequences in academia {introduction assessing the problem of gender-based violence in academia internationally is challenging due to a lack of empirical evidence and differences in how it is measured. the contribution of this article is to reflect on survey measurements and to propose new avenues for future quantitative measurements of gender-based violence, its determinants, and consequences in an academic context. for this purpose, we present the results of a scoping review of ten national and cross-national prevalence studies on gender-based violence. we examined the studies’ quantitative operationalisation of (1) sex and gender, (2) prevalence of gender-based violence, (3) socio-demographic determinants from an intersectional perspective, individual and contextual factors, (4) and consequences. materials and methods prevalence studies were identified through a comprehensive search of electronic databases and specialised data repositories. the selection criteria included studies with a focus on gender-based violence, the use of closed-ended survey questions, i.e., in a questionnaire, the potential for applicability in different national contexts, and the specific context of higher education. eligible sources also described the quantitative operationalisation of the survey measurements. results our work critically reviews previous efforts to measure gender-based violence, its determinants, and consequences in academic contexts. the findings of our assessment show, first, that quantitative gender-related measurements tend to conflate the concepts of sex and gender, and hence their operationalisation in quantitative surveys. second, there is a strong emphasis on sexual harassment and sexual violence to the detriment of other relevant forms of violence, as well as a rooting of measurement concepts in locally valid but diverse legal definitions of gender-based violence. third, there is a lack of socio-demographic determinants to provide an intersectional lens, as well as a focus on measurement frameworks that individualise the experiences of gender-based violence. this prevents a conceptualisation of harassment and abuse as a structural problem in the academic sector and ignores that violence is both as a cause and a consequence of unbalanced gendered power relations and inequalities in institutional and societal contexts. fourth, there is generally a retrospective approach to measuring the consequences of gender-based violence, which may represent a source of potential bias. we reflect on how future survey instruments could address these issues in academic environments. discussion overall, our paper demonstrates how the evidence generated by different conceptualisations and operationalisations of gender-based violence in academia, as well as its determinants and consequences, shapes how we think and talk about the problem. in doing so, this article contributes to the ongoing methodological discussion on the measurement of gender-based violence and provides a rationale for improving its measurement framework in academic environments by taking a feminist-theory informed approach to collecting these data.}",13,0.7873953945760925,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement"
From disruptive protests to disrupted news frames: Comparing German news on climate protests,"{This paper examines how news frames on disruptive climate protests differ from coverage of conventional protests in news outlets with different political leanings. Analyzing 6632 articles from 21 ideologically diverse German news sources between January 2022 and May 2023, we apply Word2Vec for semantic mapping, emotion classifiers, and qualitative evaluations to assess the frames present in the coverage of climate movements, and the anger attached to these frames. Comparing the more disruptive protests of the group “The Last Generation” and the more conventional protest movement “Fridays for Future”, we find that coverage of “Fridays for Future” varies predictably across the ideological spectrum: Right-wing outlets present protesters as extreme or criminal, while other outlets make reference to climate justice within their coverage of the protests, thereby following the movement’s own framing. When covering the more disruptive “Last Generation”, the entire news landscape engages in an emotionally-charged debate, asking whether the protesters are extremists or criminals, while barely discussing their actual demands. Amid an increasingly affectively polarized media debate on disruptive climate protests, left- and right-wing media remain divided in their evaluations of the protests, but focus on criminality and extremism rather than climate justice.

Creating Design Weights for a Panel Survey With Multiple Refreshment Samples: A General Discussion With an Application to a Probability-Based Mixed-Mode Panel,"{Panel surveys suffer from attrition, where participants drop out over time. To maintain generalizability, refreshment samples are frequently employed, bringing in new individuals, increasing the number of panelists, and balancing sample composition.

If not correctly accounted for, their inclusion may bias results. This paper addresses the issue of designing proper weights by applying the multiple-frame weighting approach proposed by Kalton and Anderson, which is generally used for cross-sectional surveys, to ongoing panel studies with refreshment samples.

We compare estimates obtained using multiple-frame weighting with those obtained using unweighted and naively weighted methods (where design weights are used as calculated for the respective samples without adjusting for the fact that some members of the population have a chance of being sampled more than once due to the refreshments).

CASMIN Versus ISCED: Validating Standard Education Variables for German Microdata,"{In German surveys, educational attainment is typically assessed through two questionnaire items: the highest general school-leaving qualification and the highest vocational qualification or higher education degree. These items are often combined into one variable for analysis, but there is no standard method for doing so. This hinders comparisons across publications and the aggregation of research data. This article presents the results of a large-scale validation of candidates for a German standard education variable based on the official International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) and the sociological Comparative Analysis of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations education scheme (CASMIN), both commonly used in Germany. Many survey datasets offer a derived ISCED variable that reflects the main ISCED levels; fewer offer CASMIN. The validation uses ALLBUS 2018 data and a data-driven selection of 157 validation variables. Candidate standard education variables that retain a higher relative partial explanatory power across validation variables in linear multiple regression models compared to the most detailed education variable are considered more valid. The results show that CASMIN-based candidates generally outperform ISCED-based candidates of the same number of categories. An ISCED-based variable performs better only when measured in a highly detailed fashion that accounts for the stratification of the German educational system. The commonly used aggregation into three broad education levels loses about half the explanatory power of the detailed variable.

"Ready or not. National identity, vote choice, and mass media: Evidence from Germany","{Exploiting the increased prominence of debates on immigration, right-wing parties often frame and campaign against immigrants as a threat to national societies. Research on national identity has shown that these parties are particularly successful among voters with an ethnically charged, exclusionary conception of nation. National identity, however, tends to be rather latent and stable, while far-right voting is much more volatile.

Mapping modern kinship networks: First results from the KINMATRIX survey,"{Objective: This study presents initial results from the KINMATRIX survey, a large-scale source of ego-centric network data offering an unprecedented level of scope and detail in mapping family relationships.

Notably, extended kin provide a unique “strength in numbers” that can enhance social transmission, integration, and support. Method: We analyzed data from anchor respondents aged 25–35 (N = 11,788 anchors; 239,220 anchor-kin dyads) collected in seven Western countries (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States). Kinship networks included a large array of nuclear, extended, and complex kin (on average, 20 kin per anchor). We used descriptive methods to examine retrospective, current, and prospective assessments of kin ties across four measures: importance, closeness, contact, and support. Results: We report three main findings: First, extended kin are central to younger adults' lives, representing at least half of the family members they are emotionally close to, regularly contact, and deem important. Second, kinship networks are matrilineally tilted. Maternal kin are emotionally closer, more frequently contacted, considered more important, and more supportive.

How affect shapes online information seeking about political actors,"{Search engines are both frequently used and widely trusted sources of current political information. While research has examined the different stages of information seeking via search, the question of how political preferences and sociodemographic factors impact political online search has received less attention. In particular, the way in which attitudinal factors, such as sentiment toward a politician or interest in their personal life motivate information seeking have not been widely studied. We present findings from a panel study that combines browser tracking data with survey results for 1863 German participants.

Radical right populism and the media: evidence from the supply side and demand side of political information in Germany,"{Hostile stances towards journalists and perceptions of media bias have become cornerstones of populist radical right identity formation.

Scoring German Alternate Uses Items Applying Large Language Models,"{The alternate uses task (AUT) is the most popular measure when it comes to the assessment of creative potential.

Therefore, we investigated the performance of different LLMs for the automated scoring of German AUT responses.

Beyond age and generations: How considering period effects reshapes our understanding of personality change.,"{Age, cohort, and period effects are three ways to explain personality trait change over time. While past research mostly focused on age differences, showing relatively consistent patterns, evidence for cohort differences is more mixed, and period differences have hardly been examined. However, age, period, and cohort are exactly collinear (age = period—cohort), such that estimates are likely confounded and always hinge on so-called identification assumptions. Identification assumptions shape substantive conclusions, and inappropriate or inconsistent strategies may explain past discrepant findings. To address this age–period–cohort identification problem in personality change, we leveraged four large-scale (Ntotal > 2 Mio) repeated cross-sectional data sets from 2003 to 2022. Our aims were to demonstrate how identification assumptions common in personality studies impact estimates for age, cohort, and period and to use weaker, substantively informed assumptions to narrow down the range of plausible solutions. Results showed that common identification strategies of constraining one temporal effect to zero can dramatically affect conclusions—less for age-graded, but more for generational differences. Using weaker assumptions, our results indicated that all three factors—age, cohort, and period—likely contribute to trait differences over time. Assuming age-graded change in a certain direction revealed cohort-related decreases in extraversion, openness, and neuroticism and increases in agreeableness, alongside period-related increases in extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness. This suggests that several previously assumed cohort differences may actually be driven by period effects, overlooked due to strong identification assumptions. Overall, highlighting the importance of appropriate identification strategies, our results offer unique insights into factors driving trait differences over time.
