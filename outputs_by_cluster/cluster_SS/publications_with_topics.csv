Comparing participation motives of professional and non-professional respondents,"{In times of declining response rates and over-surveying, improving our understanding of why people participate in surveys is more important than ever. Previous research showed that online panel participants have intrinsic (e.g., topic interest, altruism) and extrinsic (e.g., incentives) participation reasons. Our study expands this research by implementing an experiment using two common forms of survey measurement: ranking and rating. The experiment was fielded in a professional respondents’ sample from a German online panel (n = 407) and in an address-based sample (mail and online) of German non-professional respondents (n = 1,137). Besides extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, the experiment included various study design features (i.e., mode, length, data security) and the mood during the time of contact as possible reasons for participation. The results confirm previous findings regarding the motivations of online panelists but also show important differences between professional and non-professional respondents. Specifically, the main participation reasons of professionals are topic interest (intrinsic) and incentives (extrinsic), while non-professionals are primarily motivated by intrinsic reasons (topic interest and purpose of study). This notion is also supported by the Latent Class Analyses, which showed that three of the four classes for professional respondents had a high probability of naming incentives as one of their main reasons for survey participation, whereas none of the four non-professional clusters rated incentives highly. The differences between the two samples highlight that professional panel members have different motivation structures than participants in general population surveys. This may undermine generalizability, but it also provides opportunities for targeted recruitment.}",2023,International Journal of Market Research,"{experiment,motivation,professional respondents,ranking vs. rating,survey participation}","Business, Management and Accounting",SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",0.1500928196101321
Patterns and Predictors of Literacy and Numeracy Development During Adulthood: Insights from Two Longitudinal Assessment Surveys,"{Literacy (reading competence) and numeracy (mathematical competence) are indispensable prerequisites for lifelong learning and participation in today’s knowledge-based societies. However, evidence on the development of these competencies during adulthood is limited. This chapter summarizes the main findings of a research project that leveraged the unique potential of two German longitudinal assessment surveys, NEPS and PIAAC-L, to garner insights into how these competencies develop during adulthood. Both surveys offer repeated measures of adults’ competencies spaced 3–6 years apart, allowing light to be cast on two guiding questions: (1) Patterns of change: Can literacy and numeracy still change in adulthood? If so, does change involve gains or losses, and how is change distributed across sociodemographic subgroups? (2) Predictors of change: Which individual and contextual factors (e.g., participation in job-related training, engagement in literacy or numeracy practice, or basic cognitive skills) predict change in competence development? Findings suggest that competencies continue to develop across the lifespan and can change even over relatively short time periods. Gains and losses occur in equal measure. Moreover, findings pinpoint practice engagement as a crucial driver of change in competencies, while highlighting that practice engagement is itself dependent on a range of individual and contextual characteristics. Methodological insights and avenues for future research that emerged from our project are also discussed.}",2023,Methodology of Educational Measurement and Assessment,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
"And if they don't dance, they are no friends of mine: Exploring boundaries of national identity","{National identity is widely used to explain anti-immigrant attitudes and thus the appeal for right-wing (populist) parties. Yet, consensus on how to capture national identity is lacking. This article identifies ideal-typical patterns of national boundary making across 42 countries and more than 25 years beyond the ethnic–civic dichotomy and addresses the multidimensionality of national identity. Using latent class analysis and cluster analysis, four ideal-typical conceptions of nationhood are identified and shown to be differently related to national attachment, national pride, and national chauvinism. Overall, the results close the methodological–empirical gap between classical approaches and recent inductive approaches to national identity and demonstrate that national identity is a cross-cultural phenomenon with distinct types.}",2023,Nations and Nationalism,"{large-scale comparison,latent class analysis,national boundary making,national identity,nationhood}",Arts and Humanities,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",0.8512716723218599
Who Represents the Constituency? Online Political Communication by Members of Parliament in the German Mixed-Member Electoral System,"{Members of parliament (MPs) are elected via two different tiers in mixed-member electoral systems—as winners of a seat in a constituency or as party candidates under proportional rules. While previous research has identified important consequences of this “mandate divide” in parliaments, questions remain how this institutional setup affects MPs' political behavior in other arenas. Analyzing more than one million social media posts, this article investigates regional representation in the online communication of German MPs. The results show that MPs elected under a direct mandate refer approximately twice as often to their constituencies by using regionalized wording and geographic references than MPs elected under the proportional tier.

User-centric approaches for collecting Facebook data in the ‘post-API age’: experiences from two studies and recommendations for future research,"{Although other social media platforms have seen a steeper increase in users recently, Facebook is still the social networking site with the largest number of users worldwide. A large number of studies from the social and behavioral sciences have investigated the antecedents, types, and consequences of its use. In addition or as an alternative to self-reports from users, many studies have used data from the platform itself, usually collected via its Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). However, with the drastic reduction of data access via the Facebook APIs following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this data source has essentially become unavailable to academic researchers. Hence, there is a need for different modes of data access for what Freelon (2018) has called the ‘post-API age’. One promising approach is to directly collaborate with platform users to ask them to share (parts of) their personal Facebook data with researchers. This paper presents experiences from two studies employing such approaches. The first used a browser plugin to unobtrusively observe Facebook use while users are active. The second asked participants to export and share parts of their personal Facebook data archive. While both approaches yield promising insights suitable to extend or replace self-reports, both also entail specific limitations. We discuss and compare the unique advantages and limitations of both approaches and provide a list of recommendations for future research.}",2023,Information Communication and Society,"{api,data donation,digital trace data,facebook,social media}",Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.10597654737304374

A Multidisciplinary Lens of Bias in Hate Speech,"{Hate speech detection systems may exhibit discriminatory behaviours. Research in this field has focused primarily on issues of discrimination toward the language use of minoritised communities and non-White aligned English. The interrelated issues of bias, model robustness, and disproportionate harms are weakly addressed by recent evaluation approaches, which capture them only implicitly. In this paper, we recruit a multidisciplinary group of experts to bring closer this divide between fairness and trustworthy model evaluation. Specifically, we encourage the experts to discuss not only the technical, but the social, ethical, and legal aspects of this timely issue. The discussion sheds light on critical bias facets that require careful considerations when deploying hate speech detection systems in society. Crucially, they bring clarity to different approaches for assessing, becoming aware of bias from a broader perspective, and offer valuable recommendations for future research in this field.}",2023,"Proceedings of the 2023 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, ASONAM 2023","{bias,hate speech,multidisciplinary methods}",Social Sciences,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.5553863155373417

Are candidates rational when it comes to negative campaigning? Empirical evidence from three German candidate surveys,"{This article tests the assumption that candidates’ attack behavior is a result of their rational consideration of potential benefits and likely risks. Based on candidate surveys from three German state elections, we demonstrate that (i) attacks are an important strategy; (ii) on balance, candidates regard attacking opponents as a costly instead of a beneficial strategy; (iii) the differential between benefits and costs is positively associated with attack behavior; nevertheless, most candidates attack at least sometimes even when costs exceed benefits; (iv) candidate characteristics and the electoral context are rarely reflected in benefit-cost calculations; and (v) the theoretically assumed mediating role of the benefit-cost differential on attack behavior applies only to some explanatory factors. While the findings provide some evidence for rational choice explanations of negative campaigning, they also challenge some central assumptions. As such, they demonstrate the need for more comprehensive theoretical explanations and measurements of negative campaigning.}",2023,Party Politics,"{candidate survey,germany,negative campaigning,rational choice}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.08150890780492333
Early and Late Participation during the Field Period: Response Timing in a Mixed-Mode Probability-Based Panel Survey,"{Reluctance of respondents to participate in surveys has long drawn the attention of survey researchers. Yet, little is known about what drives a respondent’s decision to answer the survey invitation early or late during the field period. Moreover, we still lack evidence on response timing in longitudinal surveys. That is, the questions on whether response timing is a rather stable respondent characteristic and what—if anything—affects change in response timing across different interviews remain open. We relied on data from a mixed-mode general population panel survey collected between 2014 and 2016 to study the stability of response timing across 18 panel waves and factors that influence the decision to participate early or late in the field period. Our results suggest that the factors which had effects on response timing are different in the mail and web modes. Moreover, we found that experience with prior panel waves affected the respondent’s decision to participate early or late. Overall, the present study advocates understanding response timing as a metric variable and, consequently, the need to reflect this in modeling strategies.}",2023,Sociological Methods and Research,"{field period,mixed-mode,panel surveys,participation,reluctant respondents,response timing}",Social Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.20660047488900773
River Sampling – a Fishing Expedition: A Non-Probability Case Study,"{The ease with which large amounts of data can be collected via the Internet has led to a renewed interest in the use of non-probability samples. To that end, this paper performs a case study, comparing two non-probability datasets – one based on a river-sampling approach, one drawn from an online-access panel – to a reference probability sample. Of particular interest is the single-question river-sampling approach, as the data collected for this study presents an attempt to field a multi-item scale with such a sampling method. Each dataset consists of the same psychometric measures for two of the Big-5 personality traits, which are expected to perform independently of sample composition. To assess the similarity of the three datasets we compare their correlation matrices, apply linear and non-linear dimension reduction techniques, and analyze the distance between the datasets. Our results show that there are important limitations when implementing a multi-item scale via a single-question river sample. We find that, while the correlation between our data sets is similar, the samples are composed of persons with different personality traits.}",2023,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{big-5,non-linear dimension reduction,non-probability sample,river sample,web survey research}",Psychology,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",1.0
Baby’s CoThought: Leveraging Large Language Models for Enhanced Reasoning in Compact Models,"{Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on a variety of natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, primarily due to their in-context learning ability.

The BabyLM is then pretrained on this restructured dataset in a RoBERTa fashion. In evaluations across 4 benchmarks, our BabyLM outperforms the vanilla RoBERTa in 10 linguistic, NLU, and question-answering tasks by more than 3 points, showing a superior ability to extract contextual information. These results suggest that compact LMs pretrained on small, LLM-restructured data can better understand tasks and achieve improved performance.}",2023,"CoNLL 2023 - BabyLM Challenge at the 27th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, Proceedings",,Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0

Counterfeits on dark markets: a measurement between Jan-2014 and Sep-2015,"{Counterfeits harm consumers, governments, and intellectual property holders. They accounted for 3.3% of worldwide trades in 2016, having an estimated value of $509 billion in the same year. Estimations in the literature are mostly based on border seizures, but in this paper, we examined openly labeled counterfeits on darknet markets, which allowed us to gather and analyze information from a different perspective. Here, we analyzed data from 11 darknet markets for the period Jan-2014 and Sep-2015. The findings suggest that darknet markets harbor similar counterfeit product types to those found in seizures but that the share of watches is higher while the share of electronics, clothes, shoes, and Tobacco is lower on darknet markets. Also, darknet market counterfeits seem to have similar shipping origins as seized goods, with some exceptions, such as a relatively high share (5%) of dark market counterfeits originating from the US. Lastly, counterfeits on dark markets tend to have a relatively low price and sales volume. However, based on preliminary estimations, the equivalent products on the surface web appear to be advertised for a multiple of the prices found for darknet markets. We provide some suggestions on how information about darknet market counterfeits could be used by companies and authorities for preventative purposes, showing that insight gathering from the dark web is valuable and could be a cost-effective alternative (or compliment) to border seizures. Thus, monitoring darknet markets can help us understand the counterfeit landscape better.}",2023,Crime Science,"{crime science,fakes,forgeries,machine learning,nlp,seized goods}",Social Sciences,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.4608639762645787

A Short Scale to Measure Self-Reported Aversive Personality in Political Elites,"{In order to explain the behavior of political elites, research increasingly considers personality traits. Within this line of research, a recent focus is on socially aversive–yet non-pathological–personality traits (e.g., Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy), with the idea to better understand behavior violating generally accepted ethical, moral, and social norms. Assessments of politicians’ aversive personality traits have so far been almost exclusively based on observer reports of experts and voters. Herein, by contrast, we introduce the Political Elites Aversive Personality Scale (“PEAPS”) particularly tailored to measure self-reported aversive personality among politicians. More precisely, based on two studies with German politicians, we develop a 6-item short scale comprising aspects of different socially aversive personality traits (Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and spitefulness). The scale shows an acceptable model fit, an acceptable internal consistency, an acceptable measurement equivalence, and meaningful correlations with other (self-reported) psychological traits and campaign behavior. Moreover, the scale significantly contributes to the explanation of candidates’ negative campaigning, going beyond the explanatory power of models capturing broad, basic personality traits. Overall, the suggested scale provides interesting links to research in (political) psychology and can help to explain attitudes, behavior, and performance of political elites.}",2023,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Environmental Science,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",1.0

As such, solidarity is often called upon by politicians in a declarative way. In contrast to most prior work, we investigate an attitudinal perspective on solidarity, not behavioural or policy-preference perspectives. We look at questions such as the prevalence of solidarity attitudes among European populations, the degree to which the declared norm is shared among these populations, and whether solidarity attitudes have changed with consecutive crises in Europe. We also discuss possible antecedents of solidarity levels. Distinguishing solidarity by close and universal scopes, we find that both are associated with the identification of citizens with communities at different levels. In country and time comparisons, European societies display a good degree of homogeneity and stability. Close solidarity is more pronounced than universal solidarity, and this may have even increased over consecutive crises. There are clear differences in relation to socio-historical region, but only modest associations with the religious composition of countries in terms of denominations. One role of religiosity might be that of an identity marker, where more heterogeneity comes with lower levels of solidarity.}",2023,Philosophy and Politics - Critical Explorations,"{european crises,evs,identity,latent class analysis,solidarity}",Social Sciences,SS,23,"european, governance, crises, attitudes, levels",1.0

HOW DOES BACK TRANSLATION FARE AGAINST TEAM TRANSLATION? AN EXPERIMENTAL CASE STUDY IN THE LANGUAGE COMBINATION ENGLISH–GERMAN,"{When it comes to quality in questionnaire translation and hence comparability in comparative research, the chosen translation method is crucial for the outcome. Few empirical studies compare different translation methods—a fact which is often deplored in the research community. To fill the gap, in this study, the team translation approach is compared against a simple back-translation approach. The starting point in both cases was the initial English–German translations of ISSP (International Social Survey Program) questions. The final translations from both approaches were assessed, with a focus on how translation issues, such as mistranslations or wording issues identified in the initial translations were addressed. While none of the twenty-nine issues in the initial translation were present in the final team translation version, twenty-two of these issues were still present in the final version after the back-translation approach. For a selected number of items, we also ran a split-ballot experiment in a web survey. Only five out of fifteen items (33 percent) that went into the experiment showed significant differences between the translations, and only one could clearly be attributed to remaining errors in the back-translation version. In sum, the final translation from the team approach clearly outperformed the final translation from the back-translation approach when it comes to text-based criteria (in particular, accuracy and fluency). The quantitative test showed that many translation issues (those remaining in the translation after the back translation step) had no effect on the estimates. Nevertheless, we ask respondents to put effort into survey responding; in the same vein, we as researchers should put effort in the survey experience by providing questions that are clearly worded and free of errors, which puts the team approach ahead of the back-translation approach.}",2023,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{back translation,comparison of translation methods,questionnaire translation,split-ballot experiment,team translation}",Mathematics,SS,17,"split, questionnaire, errors, machine, languages",1.0
Bringing the political system (back) into social tipping relevant to sustainability,"{Recently, social tipping dynamics relevant to sustainability have become the subject of a growing literature. Numerous publications seek to bring the concept of tipping (back) from the natural to the social system and make important contributions to its conceptualization, definition, and constant refinement. Yet, and despite its wide array, the current literature has a blind spot: it does neither adequately integrate, conceptualize, nor measure the role of the political sphere and thus underestimates its importance for social tipping processes. This is the starting point of our contribution, which not only emphasizes the political dimension's relevance to the analysis of social tipping, but also proposes two main ways to integrate it into such analyses: by conceptualizing the political sphere either as a trigger of social tipping, or as an element that can tip itself. Moreover, to capture the complexity of the political sphere, namely the interaction between networks, actors, and processes, we suggest analysing the political sphere along its three elements: polity, politics, and policy. We illustrate the empirical benefit of these refinements by presenting a comparative case study of the nuclear phase-out in Germany and Switzerland.}",2023,Energy Policy,"{policy,political sphere,politics,polity,social tipping,tipping dynamics}",Environmental Science,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.14352894311399353
"Vocational education, tertiary education, and skill use across career stages","{Vocational education enhances smooth transitions into the labour market. However, this initial advantage might vanish over the career and eventually turn into a disadvantage because the skills of vocationally trained workers become outdated faster. So far, research has examined this potential vocational trade-off by assessing labour market outcomes such as employment and income. This study uses a different approach, it directly examines how different types of skills used at work change over the career of vocationally trained workers compared to tertiary-educated workers, and how career events shape skill-use changes. With data from the German National Education Study (NEPS), we examine five skills use dimensions based on job-tasks measures: analytical, creative, managerial, interactive, and manual skills. We find that skill-use differentials between vocational and tertiary-educated workers are only small to modest. The clearest differences relate to analytical and manual skills. Looking across career stages, the observed skill-use differentials remain rather stable across career stages - thus, the vocational skill trade-off thesis is only partially supported. Occupational mobility and unemployment contribute to observable changes, whereas job-related further training does not. Our results challenge skill-based explanations of a vocational trade-off.}",2023,European Sociological Review,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
No deal: German researchers’ publishing and citing behaviors after Big Deal negotiations with Elsevier,"{In 2014, a union of German research organizations established Projekt DEAL, a national-level project to negotiate licensing agreements with large scientific publishers.

We further investigated these effects with respect to the timing of contract cancellations, research disciplines, collaboration patterns, and article open-access status. We find evidence for a decrease in Elsevier’s market share of articles from DEAL institutions, with the largest year-on-year market share decreases occurring from 2018 to 2020 following the implementation of access restrictions. We also observe year-on-year decreases in the proportion of citations, although the decrease is smaller. We conclude that negotiations with Elsevier and access restrictions have led to some reduced willingness to publish in Elsevier journals, but that researchers are not strongly affected in their ability to cite Elsevier articles, implying that researchers use other methods to access scientific literature.}",2023,Quantitative Science Studies,"{bibliometrics,big deals,germany,open access,scholarly publishing}",Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",0.5384836000597921

Based on this experiment, we show that instructions help to reduce the number of lookups to knowledge questions in web surveys. We provide further evidence that looking up answers results in more correct answers to knowledge questions and, thus, in inflated political knowledge scores.

Negotiations between DEAL and Elsevier began in 2016, and broke down without a successful agreement in 2018; during this time, around 200 German research institutions canceled their license agreements with Elsevier, leading Elsevier to restrict journal access at those institutions.We investigated the effect on researchers’ publishing and citing behaviors from a bibliometric perspective, using a data set of ~400,000 articles published by researchers at DEAL institutions during 2012–2020. We further investigated these effects with respect to the timing of contract cancellations, research disciplines, collaboration patterns, and article open-access status. We find evidence for a decrease in Elsevier’s market share of articles from DEAL institutions, with the largest year-on-year market share decreases occurring from 2018 to 2020 following the implementation of access restrictions. We also observe year-on-year decreases in the proportion of citations, although the decrease is smaller. We conclude that negotiations with Elsevier and access restrictions have led to some reduced willingness to publish in Elsevier journals, but that researchers are not strongly affected in their ability to cite Elsevier articles, implying that researchers use other methods to access scientific literature.}",2023,Quantitative Science Studies,"{bibliometrics,big deals,germany,open access,scholarly publishing}",Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",0.5661693998864016
Disentangling the Link between Diverse Social Networks and Creativity: The Role of Personality Traits,"{Past studies have shown that being exposed to ethnocultural diversity can positively impact individual creativity. Yet, little is known about the interplay between situational (i.e., diversity) and dispositional (e.g., personality) factors in predicting creativity. Taking a person-situation approach, we use social network data to test the moderating role of personality in the relationship between having an ethnoculturally diverse network and creativity. Moreover, we investigate these questions in a diverse community sample of immigrants residing in the city of Barcelona (N = 122). Moderation analyses revealed that network diversity predicted higher levels of creativity in migrant individuals with medium to high levels of extraversion, and in those with low to medium levels of emotional stability. These results highlight the need to acknowledge the important role played by interacting individual-level dispositions and more objective meso-level contextual conditions in explaining one's ability to think creatively, especially in samples that have traditionally been underrepresented in previous literature.}",2023,Spanish Journal of Psychology,"{creativity,ethnocultural diversity,immigration,personality,social networks}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
A few people make all the difference–an international comparison of “fair” pay differentials,"{Social inequality has long been an important topic of public debate in almost all societies in the world, but how much do people actually disagree and who is that does? This paper uses all five waves of International Social Survey Programme data (1987 to 2019) to compare attitudes toward “fair” pay ratios in Germany, Italy, Hungary, Norway, Great Britain, the USA, and Russia. Although respondents generally underestimate the actual size of current earnings gaps, in all countries an overwhelming egalitarian majority agrees that “income differences are too large”. As well, since the ISSP has also asked respondents how much different occupations “should earn”, one can compare the fair pay ratios. In all countries, for all years examined, fair pay ratios are (a) remarkably small and (b) remarkably similar for roughly 80% of the population. Cross-country differences in average attitudes do not occur due to higher general levels of support for income inequality but are rather concentrated in the “inegalitarian few”. Our analysis of cross-country differences in attitudes toward inequality, therefore, concentrates on how the inegalitarian few differ from the egalitarian many, to differing degrees in different countries, to better explain the political tensions underlying differences in redistribution in market economies.}",2023,International Journal of Sociology,"{international comparison,pay differentials,social inequality}",,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.7477310134694138
Digitalization of Working Worlds and Social Inclusion,"{Digitalization is engendering profound societal transformation that is significantly restructuring our working lives. For society, and the world of work in particular, digitalization presents a major challenge, as the digital transformation of work does not simply relate to technological innovation; rather, it involves a complex sociotechnical process that is socially prepared, technically enabled, and discursively negotiated, and that ultimately must be individually mastered. As a result, the ongoing digitalization of “working worlds” is characterized by multiple dimensions and processes that evolve and proceed unevenly. These processes interact in complex ways, not uncommonly contradicting each other. Against this background, this thematic issue explores some of the implications and dynamics of the digital transformation of work concerning social inclusion.}",2023,Social Inclusion,"{digital transformation of work,digitalization,social inclusion,sociotechnical processes,world of work}",Psychology,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",0.13550985215674535
Response Quality in Nonprobability and Probability-based Online Panels,"{Recent years have seen a growing number of studies investigating the accuracy of nonprobability online panels; however, response quality in nonprobability online panels has not yet received much attention. To fill this gap, we investigate response quality in a comprehensive study of seven nonprobability online panels and three probability-based online panels with identical fieldwork periods and questionnaires in Germany. Three response quality indicators typically associated with survey satisficing are assessed: straight-lining in grid questions, item nonresponse, and midpoint selection in visual design experiments. Our results show that there is significantly more straight-lining in the nonprobability online panels than in the probability-based online panels. However, contrary to our expectations, there is no generalizable difference between nonprobability online panels and probability-based online panels with respect to item nonresponse. Finally, neither respondents in nonprobability online panels nor respondents in probability-based online panels are significantly affected by the visual design of the midpoint of the answer scale.}",2023,Sociological Methods and Research,"{nonprobability sample,online panel,probability-based sample,response quality,satisficing}",Social Sciences,SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",1.0

Should I Stay or Should I Go? Testing the Influence of Ambivalence on Vote Switching in the German Multi-party Context,"{Does political ambivalence increase vote switching? While the effects of ambivalence on vote switching have been investigated in the American political sys-tem, its application to multi-party systems has not been explored. To address this gap, this article investigates the effects of ambivalence on vote intention switching and vote switching in Germany’s multi-party system, which has recently experienced electoral instability. Using the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), the article teases out the mechanics of party ambivalence, leader ambivalence, and party-leader ambivalence. The results suggest that ambivalence increases the probability of vot-ers switching parties during the pre-election campaigning period and between two consecutive elections. Ambivalence therefore has important implications for vote switching and for understanding the underlying determinants of electoral volatility in twenty-first-century politics.}",2023,German Politics and Society,"{ambivalence,multi-party system,partisanship,political attitudes,vote switching,voting behavior}",Arts and Humanities,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Routines and the Predictability of Day-to-Day Web Use,"{Given the high importance of Web use in day-to-day life, understanding and predicting Web browsing behavior are important endeavors for academic as well as commercial research. We propose that routines–behaviors that are performed regularly (activation) and in similar ways (execution)–can be used to describe underlying structures in Web use and, thereby, improve the predictability of subsequent Web use behavior. Based on two large-scale Web-tracking data sets, we developed indicators for routine activation and execution, tested their reliability and stability, and examined their association with the predictability of six Web use behaviors: overall Web use, news use, shopping, Facebook, YouTube, and Google use. Our results show that routine measures derived from tracking data were only moderately reliable but very stable. Routine activation was consistently and substantially associated with higher predictability for all Web use behaviors, whereas routine execution was less consistently and not strongly linked to predictability.}",2023,Media Psychology,,Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",1.0
Satisficing Response Behavior Across Time: Assessing Negative Panel Conditioning Using an Experimental Design with Six Repetitions,"{Satisficing response behavior can be a threat to the quality of survey responses. Past research has provided broad empirical evidence on the existence of satisficing and its consequences on data quality, however, relatively little is known about the extent of satisficing over the course of a panel study and its impact on response quality in later waves. Drawing on panel conditioning research, we use question design experiments to investigate whether learning effects across waves of a panel study cause changes in the extent of satisficing and if so, whether general survey experience (learning of the survey process) or familiarity with specific question contents (learning of the questionnaire content) accounts for those changes. We use data from a longitudinal survey experiment comprising six panel waves administered within a German non-probability online access panel. To investigate the underlying mechanism of possible learning effects, the experimental study randomly assigned respondents to different frequencies of receiving identical question contents over the six panel waves. Our results show the existence of satisficing in every panel wave, which is in its magnitude similar to the extent of satisficing in the probability-based GESIS Panel that we use as a benchmark study. However, we did not find changes in the extent of satisficing across panel waves, nor did we find moderation effects of the interval between the waves, respondents’ cognitive ability, or motivation. Additional validity analyses showed that satisficing does not only affect the distribution of individual estimates by 15 percent or more but also can have an effect on associations between variables.}",2023,Survey Research Methods,"{form-resistant correlation hypothesis,learning effects,non-probability panel,panel conditioning,response quality,satisficing}",Social Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.13305002310192554
User-centric approaches for collecting Facebook data in the ‘post-API age’: experiences from two studies and recommendations for future research,"{Although other social media platforms have seen a steeper increase in users recently, Facebook is still the social networking site with the largest number of users worldwide. A large number of studies from the social and behavioral sciences have investigated the antecedents, types, and consequences of its use. In addition or as an alternative to self-reports from users, many studies have used data from the platform itself, usually collected via its Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). However, with the drastic reduction of data access via the Facebook APIs following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, this data source has essentially become unavailable to academic researchers. Hence, there is a need for different modes of data access for what Freelon (2018) has called the ‘post-API age’. One promising approach is to directly collaborate with platform users to ask them to share (parts of) their personal Facebook data with researchers. This paper presents experiences from two studies employing such approaches. The first used a browser plugin to unobtrusively observe Facebook use while users are active. The second asked participants to export and share parts of their personal Facebook data archive. While both approaches yield promising insights suitable to extend or replace self-reports, both also entail specific limitations. We discuss and compare the unique advantages and limitations of both approaches and provide a list of recommendations for future research.}",2023,Information Communication and Society,"{api,data donation,digital trace data,facebook,social media}",Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.10671409202575827

Establishing standards for human-annotated samples applied in supervised machine learning - Evidence from a Monte Carlo simulation,"{Automated content analyses have become a popular tool in communication science. While standard procedures for manual content analysis were established decades ago, it remains an open question whether these standards are sufficient for the use of human-annotated data to train supervised machine learning models. Scholars typically follow a two-stage procedure to obtain high prediction accuracy: manual content analysis followed by model training with human-annotated samples. We argue that a loss in prediction accuracy in supervised machine learning builds up over this two-stage procedure.

Coder agreement prior to conducting manual content analysis remains an important quality criterion for automated content analyses. A Krippendorff's alpha of at least 0.8 is desirable to achieve satisfying prediction results after machine learning. Systematic errors (individual and joint) must be avoided at all costs.

Ethnic Differences in Social Capital Mobilization at the Transition to Vocational Training in Germany,"{In this chapter, we provide an in-depth analysis of the differences between students with and without a migration background in Germany in mobilising social capital during the transition to vocational education and training (VET) after lower secondary education. Besides retrospective information, we analyse (hypothetical) prospective information. Furthermore, we distinguish between different kinds of social contacts and different types of support. Using data from the first five waves of starting cohort 4 (9th graders) of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) we find that students rely heavily on their social contacts, with parents playing the most important role. Regarding general information and support, we find only small ethnic differences in the mobilization of non-institutional social contacts. In contrast, adolescents with a migration background tend to receive specific assistance less often from relatives outside the nuclear family and substantively less often from parents. Our results suggest that the general motivation of non-institutional social contacts to provide support at the transition to VET does not differ between natives and migrants, but that the ability of these ties to provide more specific, instrumental assistance depends on their receiving-country-specific resources and thus on their migration history.}",2023,Methodology of Educational Measurement and Assessment,"{ethnic differences,migrants,network mobilization,school-to-work transition,social capital,vocational training}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Children and youth at risk in times of transition: International and interdisciplinary perspectives,"{Children and youth belong to one of the most vulnerable groups in societies. This was the case even before the current humanitarian crises around the world which led millions of people and families to flee from wars, terror, poverty and exploitation. Minors have been denied human rights such as access to education, food and health services. They have been kidnapped, sold, manipulated, mutilated, killed, and injured. This has been and continues to be the case in both developed and developing countries, and it does not look as if the situation will improve in the near future. Rather, current geopolitical developments, political and economic uncertainties and instabilities seem to be increasing the vulnerability of minors, especially in the wars and armed conflicts currently being waged not only in Europe, but on almost every continent. How can risks children and youth are exposed to in times of transition be reduced? Which role do state agencies, non-governmental organisations, as well as children's coping strategies play in mitigating the vulnerabilities of minors? This volume addresses risks to which children and young people are exposed, especially in times of transition. The focus is on different groups of children in the European wartime and post-war societies of the Second World War, 'occupation children' in Germany, teenage National Socialist collaborators in Norway, and more recent cases such as child soldiers, refugee children, and children of European ""Islamic State"" fighters.

Our interest in the visuality of COVID-19 is attributed to images being an effective means of communicating complex phenomena that are hard to express verbally. Furthermore, the potential of images for stirring emotional responses makes them a potent catalyst of societal mobilization at the time of crisis but also results in their frequent (ab)use for manipulating public opinion. We looked at how classic news frames (e.g., the attribution of responsibility, human interest, and economics) are used in relation to COVID-19 and how their visual composition varies between the search engines. Our preliminary findings indicate significant differences in the use of frames such as the less pronounced use of classic news frames in English and Russian compared with Chinese.}",2023,COVID Communication: Exploring Pandemic Discourse,"{algorithm audit,covid,framing,google,image search,news frames,search engine,visual communication}",,SS,10,"covid 19 pandemic, trust, actor, social science, hybrid",1.0

"The Role of Public Opinion Research in the Democratic Process: Insights from Politicians, Journalists, and the General Public","{This study reveals the existence of a paradox in how the public views polling within the democratic process. Specifically, even though the public believes that it can influence policymaking, it considers public opinion polls not as useful as other, less representative forms of public input, such as comments at town hall meetings. Analyzing data from multiple surveys conducted in the United States of America, we find no evidence for the democratic representation hypothesis with respect to polling. Comparisons across stakeholders (public, journalists, and politicians) demonstrate that general perceptions of inputs into the democratic process are similar, which confirms the citizen-elite congruence hypothesis. However, unlike members of the public, experts are more likely to believe that public opinion polls are the optimal method by which the public can successfully inform policymaking, a finding consistent with the legitimization hypothesis. With respect to perceptions of politicians, we found substantial differences regarding party registration with Democrats and Independents favoring public opinion polling and Republicans preferring alternative methods (e.g., town hall meetings) of informing policymakers.}",2023,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{democratic representation,media,policymaking,politicians,preferences,public opinion research,public policy,survey value}",Mathematics,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",1.0

Pre-existing company contacts and premature termination of apprenticeship training in Germany,"{Using longitudinal data from Starting Cohort 4 of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we examined whether pre-existing strong ties and weak ties in the training company are associated with the risk of premature termination of apprenticeship training in Germany. This is highly relevant for the literature on social capital in the labor market since so far little is known about the role of social contacts for the turnover propensity of labor market entrants. By examining a potentially important factor for a successful labor market integration, our research also adds to both the school-to-work and the social stratification literature. Our empirical results are only partly consistent with our theoretically derived expectations. While contrary to our expectations, we found no association between strong ties and termination probability, weak ties were, as expected, associated with a lower probability of premature training termination among those apprentices who were trained in their desired occupation. Our main results, combined with several robustness checks, let us assume that this is due to better matched training situations.}",2023,Research in Social Stratification and Mobility,"{matching quality,pre-existing company contacts,premature termination of apprenticeship training,school-to-work transition,strong and weak ties}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: A question of gender and parenting style?,"{“Left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. But how do political ideological attitudes emerge? One central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. However, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. Nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the European context. This paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. Hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? How does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? These questions are examined using the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and Entrepreneurship (CUPESSE) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. First, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 European countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. Furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. The results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. It also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.}",2023,Frontiers in Political Science,"{intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.0022013956776228923
Open-ended versus Closed Probes: Assessing Different Formats of Web Probing,"{The method of web probing integrates cognitive interviewing techniques into web surveys and is increasingly used to evaluate survey questions. In a usual web probing scenario, probes are administered immediately after the question to be tested (concurrent probing), typically as open-ended questions. A second possibility of administering probes is in a closed format, whereby the response categories for the closed probes are developed during previously conducted qualitative cognitive interviews. Using closed probes has several benefits, such as reduced costs and time efficiency, because this method does not require manual coding of open-ended responses. In this article, we investigate whether the insights gained into item functioning when implementing closed probes are comparable to the insights gained when asking open-ended probes and whether closed probes are equally suitable to capture the cognitive processes for which traditionally open-ended probes are intended. The findings reveal statistically significant differences with regard to the variety of themes, the patterns of interpretation, the number of themes per respondent, and nonresponse. No differences in number of themes across formats by sex and educational level were found.}",2023,Sociological Methods and Research,"{cognitive interviewing,embedded closed probes,open-ended questions,web probing,web survey}",Social Sciences,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",1.0
Eleven strategies for making reproducible research and open science training the norm at research institutions,"{Reproducible research and open science practices have the potential to accelerate scientific progress by allowing others to reuse research outputs, and by promoting rigorous research that is more likely to yield trustworthy results. However, these practices are uncommon in many fields, so there is a clear need for training that helps and encourages researchers to integrate reproducible research and open science practices into their daily work. Here, we outline eleven strategies for making training in these practices the norm at research institutions. The strategies, which emerged from a virtual brainstorming event organized in collaboration with the German Reproducibility Network, are concentrated in three areas: (i) adapting research assessment criteria and program requirements; (ii) training; (iii) building communities. We provide a brief overview of each strategy, offer tips for implementation, and provide links to resources. We also highlight the importance of allocating resources and monitoring impact. Our goal is to encourage researchers - in their roles as scientists, supervisors, mentors, instructors, and members of curriculum, hiring or evaluation committees - to think creatively about the many ways they can promote reproducible research and open science practices in their institutions.}",2023,eLife,"{curriculum design,higher education,medicine,open science,reproducible research,scientific rigor,transparency}",,SS,20,"open science, social media, publications, training, retrieval",1.0
Using Double Machine Learning to Understand Nonresponse in the Recruitment of a Mixed-Mode Online Panel,"{Survey scientists increasingly face the problem of high-dimensionality in their research as digitization makes it much easier to construct high-dimensional (or “big”) data sets through tools such as online surveys and mobile applications. Machine learning methods are able to handle such data, and they have been successfully applied to solve predictive problems. However, in many situations, survey statisticians want to learn about causal relationships to draw conclusions and be able to transfer the findings of one survey to another. Standard machine learning methods provide biased estimates of such relationships. We introduce into survey statistics the double machine learning approach, which gives approximately unbiased estimators of parameters of interest, and show how it can be used to analyze survey nonresponse in a high-dimensional panel setting. The double machine learning approach here assumes unconfoundedness of variables as its identification strategy. In high-dimensional settings, where the number of potential confounders to include in the model is too large, the double machine learning approach secures valid inference by selecting the relevant confounding variables.}",2023,Social Science Computer Review,"{causal inference,gesis panel,machine learning,panel dropout,survey nonresponse}",Computer Science,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.07896438377201243

Our analyses were based on data from a large-scale German online web tracking panel (N = 3018) gathered from June 2018 to June 2019. The study we present here has two parts: In the first part, we looked at group differences (gender and age) in tracked OPU.

In the second part of our study, we combined the web tracking data with data from an online survey which was answered by a subset of the tracking participants (n = 1315) to assess the relevance of various predictors of OPU that have been identified in previous research. Again, our results mostly echoed previous findings based on self-reports. Online pornography was used more by males and younger individuals, while relationship status, sexist attitudes, and social dominance orientation were not associated with OPU. However, we did find differences in OPU between members of different religious communities.

Response Behavior and Quality of Survey Data: Comparing Elderly Respondents in Institutions and Private Households,"{An increasing age of respondents and cognitive impairment are usual suspects for increasing difficulties in survey interviews and a decreasing data quality. This is why survey researchers tend to label residents in retirement and nursing homes as hard-to-interview and exclude them from most social surveys. In this article, I examine to what extent this label is justified and whether quality of data collected among residents in institutions for the elderly really differs from data collected within private households. For this purpose, I analyze the response behavior and quality indicators in three waves of Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. To control for confounding variables, I use propensity score matching to identify respondents in private households who share similar characteristics with institutionalized residents.

Differential Racism in the News: Using Semi-Supervised Machine Learning to Distinguish Explicit and Implicit Stigmatization of Ethnic and Religious Groups in Journalistic Discourse,"{News coverage plays a crucial role in the formation of attitudes toward ethnic and religious minority groups. On the attitudinal level, it is an established notion that individuals’ explicit and implicit judgments of the same groups can vary. Yet, less is known about the prevalence of implicit group judgments in news coverage. Focusing on a large variety of ethnic and religious minority groups in Germany, the present study sets out to fill this gap. We use semi-supervised machine learning to distinguish explicit and implicit stigmatization of ethnic and religious groups in German journalistic coverage (n = 697,913 articles). Findings suggest that groups that are associated with less wealthy countries, and with culturally more distant countries, face more stigmatization, both explicitly and implicitly. Yet, the data also show that groups associated with Islam and groups with large refugee populations living in the country of study are implicitly, but not explicitly stigmatized in news coverage. We discuss these and other resulting patterns against the backdrop of sociological and psychological intergroup theories and reflect upon their implications for journalism.}",2023,Political Communication,"{automated content analysis,ethnicity,journalism,news,race,stigmatization}",Social Sciences,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",1.0
"Truth and Bias, Left and Right: Testing Ideological Asymmetries with a Realistic News Supply","{The debate around ""fake news""has raised the question of whether liberals and conservatives differ, first, in their ability to discern true from false information, and second, in their tendency to give more credit to information that is ideologically congruent. Typical designs to measure these asymmetries select, often arbitrarily, a small set of news items as experimental stimuli without clear reference to a ""population of information.""This pre-registered study takes an alternative approach by, first, conceptualizing estimands in relation to all political news. Second, to represent this target population, it uses a set of 80 randomly sampled items from a large collection of articles from Google News and three fact-checking sites. In a subsequent survey, a quota sample of US participants (n = 1,393) indicate whether they believe the news items to be true.

Issue trade-offs and the politics of representation: Experimental evidence from four European democracies,"{The politics of representation has become increasingly complex in recent years. Amid weakening traditional political cleavages, the emergence of new political divides and mounting anti-elitism that have helped the rise of radical populist parties, voters face significant cross-pressures when casting their ballots. Despite a wealth of studies on the role of issue preferences in voting behaviour, there are still many unknowns when it comes to understanding how voters trade off competing issue preferences against each other. Studying issue trade-offs is also important against the backdrop of the well-documented preferences of radical left and right voters for redistribution and restrictive immigration policies, respectively. To investigate the strength of issue preferences among radical left, radical right and mainstream party voters and the willingness to compromise on their most important issues, we conducted a conjoint survey experiment with 2,000 participants in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The voting scenario in the experiment featured proposals on salient political issues and different (non)populist stances on political representation. The results from the cross-country study, as well as a large replication study with a sample of 4,000 German respondents, show that voters of radical right parties are willing to accept large trade-offs regarding their other issue preferences as long as their preference for restrictive immigration policies is fulfilled. Differently, radical left, Green and mainstream party voters have a more variegated range of issue preferences, some of them so strong that they are not traded off for their preferred redistribution and European Union integration positions, respectively. The findings shed light on trade-offs related to emerging issues such as climate change and the distinct logics behind support for radical parties. They also have implications for the electoral prospects of mainstream and radical parties when trying to reposition themselves in the diversifying issue space of contemporary democracies. As such, understanding how voters navigate issue cross-pressures helps to explain the broader dynamics that are (re)configuring political conflict and voting behaviour in Europe.}",2023,European Journal of Political Research,"{cleavages,issue trade-offs,radical left parties,radical right parties,survey experiment}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.18585331645914163
Multi-label classification of open-ended questions with BERT,"{Open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. However, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. Traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. In the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. Most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. However, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. This paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. Here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. We evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the German language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES Panel (N=17,584, 55 labels). We evaluate the algorithms on 0/1 loss. We find that classification with BERT (forcing at least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered (18.9%-21.6%). Our work has important implications for social scientists: 1) Multi-label classification with BERT works in the German language for open-ends. 2) For mildly multi-label classification tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic classification. Previously, the loss was more substantial, usually requiring semiautomatic approaches. 3) Unlike the nearest competitor, ECC, multi-label classification with BERT requires only a single model for all labels.}",2023,"2023 Big Data Meets Survey Science, BigSurv 2023","{all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology}",Mathematics,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",1.0
Left behind in a public services wasteland? On the accessibility of public services and political trust,"{Public discourse and scholars alike argue that the spatial divide in voting behavior and attitudes is rooted in geographic inequalities that serve as breeding grounds for political discontent. In previous studies, scholars have mainly focused on the economic conditions to analyze how place-based context influences the voting behavior of citizens. However, this focus on voting behavior and a small set of contextual variables do not allow us to draw direct conclusions as to how, and which, place-based factors relate to discontent on the attitudinal level. I argue that the accessibility of public service infrastructure specifically serves as a low-intensity information cue for citizens to evaluate the political performance of modern welfare states. These evaluations complement objective economic perceptions and are part of the performance-trust link. Hence, citizens should trust the government less if public services are not provided or only hard to access. I test this relationship for the German case by spatially linking the addresses of survey respondents with the location of public service facilities and collective municipallevel data. The resulting unique data set allows to explore the relationship between the accessibility of public service facilities and political trust as well as their temporal development. Results of multilevel analyses indicate that shorter distances to train stations are associated with increased trust in the government, but all other results, such as the change in service provision, remain inconclusive. The findings implicate that a long-term lack of public services contributes to geographically polarized discontent in Germany.}",2023,Political Geography,,Arts and Humanities,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.1762390756901137
Know What Not To Know: Users' Perception of Abstaining Classifiers,"{Machine learning systems can help humans to make decisions by providing decision suggestions (i.e., a label for a datapoint). However, individual datapoints do not always provide enough clear evidence to make confident suggestions. Although methods exist that enable systems to identify those datapoints and subsequently abstain from suggesting a label, it remains unclear how users would react to such system behavior. This paper presents first findings from a user study on systems that do or do not abstain from labeling ambiguous datapoints. Our results show that label suggestions on ambiguous datapoints bear a high risk of unconsciously influencing the users' decisions, even toward incorrect ones. Furthermore, participants perceived a system that abstains from labeling uncertain datapoints as equally competent and trustworthy as a system that delivers label suggestions for all datapoints. Consequently, if abstaining does not impair a system's credibility, it can be a useful mechanism to increase decision quality.}",2023,DIS 2023 Companion: Companion Publication of the 2023 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference,"{abstaining,human-centered machine learning,perception}",Computer Science,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0

Fake News Detection in Low Resource Languages using SetFit Framework,"{Social media has become an integral part of people’s lives, resulting in a constant flow of information. However, a concerning trend has emerged with the rapid spread of fake news, attributed to the lack of verification mechanisms. Fake news has far-reaching consequences, influencing public opinion, disrupting democracy, fueling social tensions, and impacting various domains such as health, environment, and the economy. In order to identify fake news with data sparsity especially with low resources languages such as Arabic and its dialects, we propose a few-shot learning fake news detection model based on sentence transformer fine tuning, utilizing no crafted prompts and language model with few parameters. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve higher performances with fewer news samples. This approach provided 71% F1 score on the Algerian dialect fake news dataset and 70% F1 score on the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) version of the same dataset, which prove that the approach can work on the standard Arabic and its dialects. Therefore, the proposed model can identify fake news in several domains concerning the Algerian community such as politics, COVID-19, tourism, ecommerce, sport, accidents and cars prices.}",2023,Inteligencia Artificial,"{algerian dialect,arabic,bert,deep learning,fake news,few-shot learning,msa,normalization,social media}",Computer Science,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",1.0
Applying multilevel regression weighting when only population margins are available,"{Reliable survey data is needed to be able to infer survey findings to the general population. However, self-selection or panel attrition of the survey respondents may bias survey estimations. To tackle these challenges, weighting adjustments have been established to correct for different inclusion probabilities and to reduce bias in the survey. These strategies adjust the survey data to match known population statistics (e.g., means and proportions). The usefulness of weighting strategies depends on the benchmarks of the variables available from official statistics or other highly reliable sources, for instance, whether population information on the weighting variables is available as joint distributions of all variables or as margins only. While complex weighting strategies have been developed for poststratification using joint distributions (for example multilevel regression and poststratification), these methods are not applicable when only population margins are available. In this paper, we propose two practical approaches that combine the multilevel regression weighting method with weighting algorithms using marginal population distributions only. In a simulation study, we applied both approaches to volunteer samples.}",2023,Communications in Statistics: Simulation and Computation,"{complex estimation,marginal population distributions,multilevel regression,weighting}",Mathematics,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.42713051177173167
Patterns and Predictors of Literacy and Numeracy Development During Adulthood: Insights from Two Longitudinal Assessment Surveys,"{Literacy (reading competence) and numeracy (mathematical competence) are indispensable prerequisites for lifelong learning and participation in today’s knowledge-based societies. However, evidence on the development of these competencies during adulthood is limited. This chapter summarizes the main findings of a research project that leveraged the unique potential of two German longitudinal assessment surveys, NEPS and PIAAC-L, to garner insights into how these competencies develop during adulthood. Both surveys offer repeated measures of adults’ competencies spaced 3–6 years apart, allowing light to be cast on two guiding questions: (1) Patterns of change: Can literacy and numeracy still change in adulthood? If so, does change involve gains or losses, and how is change distributed across sociodemographic subgroups? (2) Predictors of change: Which individual and contextual factors (e.g., participation in job-related training, engagement in literacy or numeracy practice, or basic cognitive skills) predict change in competence development? Findings suggest that competencies continue to develop across the lifespan and can change even over relatively short time periods. Gains and losses occur in equal measure. Moreover, findings pinpoint practice engagement as a crucial driver of change in competencies, while highlighting that practice engagement is itself dependent on a range of individual and contextual characteristics.

Advance Translation—The Remedy to Improve Translatability of Source Questionnaires?

My study confirms the usefulness of advance translation in making source items better to translate, thus improving final translation quality. It appears to be particularly useful for comprehensibility issues of the source text, irrespective of the target language. I recommend that advance translations be carried out into all languages and cultures into which the final source questionnaire is to be translated.

Features we use include domain-specific controversial topics (CT), word embeddings (WE), part-of-speech (POS) tags, and others. In addition, we explore various ways of increasing labeled data size to effectively train the models, such as increasing positive (IncPos) samples, active learning (AL), and utilizing labeled data in other languages.

People Make Better Edits: Measuring the Efficacy of LLM-Generated Counterfactually Augmented Data for Harmful Language Detection,"{NLP models are used in a variety of critical social computing tasks, such as detecting sexist, racist, or otherwise hateful content. Therefore, it is imperative that these models are robust to spurious features. Past work has attempted to tackle such spurious features using training data augmentation, including Counterfactually Augmented Data (CADs). CADs introduce minimal changes to existing training data points and flip their labels; training on them may reduce model dependency on spurious features. However, manually generating CADs can be time-consuming and expensive. Hence in this work, we assess if this task can be automated using generative NLP models. We automatically generate CADs using Polyjuice, ChatGPT, and Flan-T5, and evaluate their usefulness in improving model robustness compared to manually-generated CADs. By testing both model performance on multiple out-of-domain test sets and individual data point efficacy, our results show that while manual CADs are still the most effective, CADs generated by ChatGPT come a close second. One key reason for the lower performance of automated methods is that the changes they introduce are often insufficient to flip the original label.}",2023,"EMNLP 2023 - 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings",,Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0

Evaluating an Alternative Frame for Address-Based Sampling in Germany: The Address Database From Deutsche Post Direkt,"{In Germany, the population registers with addresses of individuals can be used for address-based sampling. However, unlike countries with a centralized register, municipalities in Germany administer their registers themselves. This not only makes sampling for a nationwide survey more costly and cumbersome but may also result in gaps in the gross sample, as selected municipalities may refuse to allow their registers to be used for sampling purposes. If substitute municipalities are not available, other sampling methods are required. The present study tested the feasibility of using the address database from Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously conducted two almost identical surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of equal size (N = 3,000). One sample was drawn from the city’s population register, the other from the commercial ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD could be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules. However, these benefits come at considerable cost. First, the use of the ADB-DPD is limited to self-administered surveys. More importantly, in the net sample of the DPD survey, women and young persons were considerably underrepresented. This indicates coverage issues about which DPD provided no further information. Based on our analyses, we offer practical insights into the feasibility of using the ADB-DPD for sampling purposes and suggest avenues for future research.}",2023,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{address-based sampling,alternative sampling frame,population register,sample composition,sample evaluation}",Computer Science,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",0.0431560327645667

For an encompassing evaluation of the link between incentives and panel recruitment, the article further assesses the incentives’ implications for demographic composition and panel recruitment unit costs. Multivariate analysis indicates that low combined incentives (€5/€5) or, where unconditional disbursement is unfeasible, high conditional incentives (€20) are most effective in enhancing panel participation. In terms of demographic bias, low combined incentives (€5/€5) and €10 conditional incentives are the favored options.

Comparisons across stakeholders (public, journalists, and politicians) demonstrate that general perceptions of inputs into the democratic process are similar, which confirms the citizen-elite congruence hypothesis. However, unlike members of the public, experts are more likely to believe that public opinion polls are the optimal method by which the public can successfully inform policymaking, a finding consistent with the legitimization hypothesis.

Evaluating Transferability in Multilingual Text Analyses,"{Multilingual text analysis is increasingly important to address the current narrow focus of English and other Indo-European languages in comparative studies. However, there has been a lack of a comprehensive approach to evaluate the validity of multilingual text analytic methods across different language contexts. To address this issue, we propose that the validity of multilingual text analysis should be studied through the lens of transferability, which assesses the extent to which the performance of a multilingual text analytic method can be maintained when switching from one language context to another. We first formally conceptualize transferability in multilingual text analysis as a measure of whether the method is equivalent across language groups (linguistic transferability) and societal contexts (contextual transferability). We propose a model-agnostic approach to evaluate transferability using (1) natural and synthetic data pairs, (2) manual annotation of errors, and (3) the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique. As an application of our approach, we analyze the transferability of a multilingual BERT (mBERT) model fine-tuned with annotated manifestos and media texts from five Indo-European language-speaking countries of the Comparative Agendas Project. The transferability is then evaluated using natural and synthetic parliamentary data from the UK, Basque, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.

Comparing participation motives of professional and non-professional respondents,"{In times of declining response rates and over-surveying, improving our understanding of why people participate in surveys is more important than ever. Previous research showed that online panel participants have intrinsic (e.g., topic interest, altruism) and extrinsic (e.g., incentives) participation reasons. Our study expands this research by implementing an experiment using two common forms of survey measurement: ranking and rating. The experiment was fielded in a professional respondents’ sample from a German online panel (n = 407) and in an address-based sample (mail and online) of German non-professional respondents (n = 1,137). Besides extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, the experiment included various study design features (i.e., mode, length, data security) and the mood during the time of contact as possible reasons for participation. The results confirm previous findings regarding the motivations of online panelists but also show important differences between professional and non-professional respondents. Specifically, the main participation reasons of professionals are topic interest (intrinsic) and incentives (extrinsic), while non-professionals are primarily motivated by intrinsic reasons (topic interest and purpose of study). This notion is also supported by the Latent Class Analyses, which showed that three of the four classes for professional respondents had a high probability of naming incentives as one of their main reasons for survey participation, whereas none of the four non-professional clusters rated incentives highly. The differences between the two samples highlight that professional panel members have different motivation structures than participants in general population surveys.

For society, and the world of work in particular, digitalization presents a major challenge, as the digital transformation of work does not simply relate to technological innovation; rather, it involves a complex sociotechnical process that is socially prepared, technically enabled, and discursively negotiated, and that ultimately must be individually mastered. As a result, the ongoing digitalization of “working worlds” is characterized by multiple dimensions and processes that evolve and proceed unevenly. These processes interact in complex ways, not uncommonly contradicting each other. Against this background, this thematic issue explores some of the implications and dynamics of the digital transformation of work concerning social inclusion.}",2023,Social Inclusion,"{digital transformation of work,digitalization,social inclusion,sociotechnical processes,world of work}",Social Sciences,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",0.14056027884801175
Explaining cheating in schools with Situational Action Theory: Within-estimations using a German school panel,"{Wikström's Situational Action Theory (SAT) explains rule-breaking by reference to the cognitive perception-choice process, which indicates how a person's propensity to break rules interacts with the setting's criminogeneity. SAT's situational model claims that the interaction between personal morality and the moral norms of the setting, the so-called moral filter, is critical in the explanation of rule-breaking, and that the influence of self-control is subordinate to this process. Self-control becomes relevant when individuals whose personal morality discourages rule-breaking are exposed to settings in which the moral norms encourage rule-breaking, that is, if the moral filter is conflicted. Whereas most previous studies have equated the moral filter with personal morality, we consider the moral norms of the setting as well. This allows for a more rigorous test of the moral filter, and thus the conditionality of self-control. Here, we investigate student cheating, using data from two waves of a large-scale German school panel study, and we conceptualise the setting's moral norms by reference to the descriptive norm: other students’ cheating behaviour. This ensures the spatio-linkage between the setting's criminogeneity and rule-breaking, which is necessary for investigating SAT. Additionally, our estimation strategy – person and school fixed-effect models – controls for alternative explanations by the selection of people into settings with different levels of criminogeneity. Moreover, it controls for heterogeneity across persons and schools. The findings are in line with SAT's predictions. In cases of a correspondence between personal morality and the moral norms of a setting, students with rule-abiding morality are least likely to cheat, whereas students with a rule-breaking morality are the most likely to cheat. Also, in line with SAT, self-control only matters for students with rule-abiding morality when they are exposed to moral norms that encourage rule-breaking.}",2023,European Journal of Criminology,"{fixed-effects estimation,moral filter,morality,self-control,situational action theory,student cheating}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.3263159306904706

Evaluating an Alternative Frame for Address-Based Sampling in Germany: The Address Database From Deutsche Post Direkt,"{In Germany, the population registers with addresses of individuals can be used for address-based sampling. However, unlike countries with a centralized register, municipalities in Germany administer their registers themselves. This not only makes sampling for a nationwide survey more costly and cumbersome but may also result in gaps in the gross sample, as selected municipalities may refuse to allow their registers to be used for sampling purposes. If substitute municipalities are not available, other sampling methods are required. The present study tested the feasibility of using the address database from Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously conducted two almost identical surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of equal size (N = 3,000). One sample was drawn from the city’s population register, the other from the commercial ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD could be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules. However, these benefits come at considerable cost. First, the use of the ADB-DPD is limited to self-administered surveys. More importantly, in the net sample of the DPD survey, women and young persons were considerably underrepresented. This indicates coverage issues about which DPD provided no further information. Based on our analyses, we offer practical insights into the feasibility of using the ADB-DPD for sampling purposes and suggest avenues for future research.}",2023,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{address-based sampling,alternative sampling frame,population register,sample composition,sample evaluation}",Mathematics,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",0.04318823835893387

TSNN: A Topic and Structure Aware Neural Network for Rumor Detection,"{Detecting rumors on social media and preventing its spread play a critical role for politics, economy, etc. Conventional studies mainly focus on exploiting the content or context of the source post, while they always ignore the rich topic information within the source post. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a Topic and Structure Aware Neural Network (TSNN) for rumor detection. To be specific, we explore two kinds of topic signals, including a coarse-grained topic signal (i.e., topic credibility) and a fine-grained topic signal (i.e., latent topic representation), and tailor them to the task of rumor detection. Moreover, we introduce a new auxiliary task, i.e., topic credibility prediction, in order to effectively leverage the rich topic information within source posts. Finally, we develop a multi-task learning strategy that helps improve rumor detection performance by jointly learning the task of topic credibility prediction and user credibility prediction. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach TSNN is superior to the state-of-the-art baseline methods.}",2023,Neurocomputing,"{multi-task learning,neural topic models,rumor detection,topic credibility}",Computer Science,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.5045962744729164
Know What Not To Know: Users' Perception of Abstaining Classifiers,"{Machine learning systems can help humans to make decisions by providing decision suggestions (i.e., a label for a datapoint). However, individual datapoints do not always provide enough clear evidence to make confident suggestions. Although methods exist that enable systems to identify those datapoints and subsequently abstain from suggesting a label, it remains unclear how users would react to such system behavior. This paper presents first findings from a user study on systems that do or do not abstain from labeling ambiguous datapoints. Our results show that label suggestions on ambiguous datapoints bear a high risk of unconsciously influencing the users' decisions, even toward incorrect ones. Furthermore, participants perceived a system that abstains from labeling uncertain datapoints as equally competent and trustworthy as a system that delivers label suggestions for all datapoints. Consequently, if abstaining does not impair a system's credibility, it can be a useful mechanism to increase decision quality.}",2023,DIS 2023 Companion: Companion Publication of the 2023 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference,"{abstaining,human-centered machine learning,perception}",Computer Science,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
Using Double Machine Learning to Understand Nonresponse in the Recruitment of a Mixed-Mode Online Panel,"{Survey scientists increasingly face the problem of high-dimensionality in their research as digitization makes it much easier to construct high-dimensional (or “big”) data sets through tools such as online surveys and mobile applications. Machine learning methods are able to handle such data, and they have been successfully applied to solve predictive problems. However, in many situations, survey statisticians want to learn about causal relationships to draw conclusions and be able to transfer the findings of one survey to another. Standard machine learning methods provide biased estimates of such relationships. We introduce into survey statistics the double machine learning approach, which gives approximately unbiased estimators of parameters of interest, and show how it can be used to analyze survey nonresponse in a high-dimensional panel setting. The double machine learning approach here assumes unconfoundedness of variables as its identification strategy. In high-dimensional settings, where the number of potential confounders to include in the model is too large, the double machine learning approach secures valid inference by selecting the relevant confounding variables.}",2023,Social Science Computer Review,"{causal inference,gesis panel,machine learning,panel dropout,survey nonresponse}",Social Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.08040676106284794
PREDICTING NONRESPONSE IN FUTURE WAVES OF A PROBABILITY-BASED MIXED-MODE PANEL WITH MACHINE LEARNING,"{Nonresponse in panel studies can lead to a substantial loss in data quality owing to its potential to introduce bias and distort survey estimates. Recent work investigates the usage of machine learning to predict nonresponse in advance, such that predicted nonresponse propensities can be used to inform the data collection process. However, predicting nonresponse in panel studies requires accounting for the longitudinal data structure in terms of model building, tuning, and evaluation. This study proposes a longitudinal framework for predicting nonresponse with machine learning and multiple panel waves and illustrates its application. With respect to model building, this approach utilizes information from multiple waves by introducing features that aggregate previous (non)response patterns. Concerning model tuning and evaluation, temporal crossvalidation is employed by iterating through pairs of panel waves such that the training and test sets move in time. Implementing this approach with data from a German probability-based mixed-mode panel shows that aggregating information over multiple panel waves can be used to build prediction models with competitive and robust performance over all test waves.}",2023,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{machine learning,nonresponse,panel attrition,prediction,temporal crossvalidation}",Mathematics,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.07857602247896935

"Sharing social media data: The role of past experiences, attitudes, norms, and perceived behavioral control","{Social media data (SMD) have become an important data source in the social sciences. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the experiences and practices of researchers working with SMD in their research and gain insights into researchers' sharing behavior and influencing factors for their decisions. To achieve these aims, we conducted a survey study among researchers working with SMD. The questionnaire covered different topics related to accessing, (re)using, and sharing SMD. To examine attitudes toward data sharing, perceived subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, we used questions based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). We employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results of the qualitative analysis show that the main reasons for not sharing SMD were that sharing was not considered or needed, as well as legal and ethical challenges. The quantitative analyses reveal that there are differences in the relative importance of past sharing and reuse experiences, experienced challenges, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control as predictors of future SMD sharing intentions, depending on the way the data should be shared (publicly, with restricted access, or upon personal request). Importantly, the TPB variables have predictive power for all types of SMD sharing.}",2023,Frontiers in Big Data,"{data management,data reuse,data sharing,social media data,theory of planned behavior}",Computer Science,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",0.6840083953376492
Multi-label classification of open-ended questions with BERT,"{Open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. However, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. Traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. In the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. Most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. However, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. This paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. Here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. We evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the German language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES Panel (N=17,584, 55 labels). We evaluate the algorithms on 0/1 loss. We find that classification with BERT (forcing at least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered (18.9%-21.6%). Our work has important implications for social scientists: 1) Multi-label classification with BERT works in the German language for open-ends. 2) For mildly multi-label classification tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic classification. Previously, the loss was more substantial, usually requiring semiautomatic approaches. 3) Unlike the nearest competitor, ECC, multi-label classification with BERT requires only a single model for all labels.}",2023,"2023 Big Data Meets Survey Science, BigSurv 2023","{all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology}",Decision Sciences,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",0.9459307648234652

Digitalisation as a Prospect for Work–Life Balance and Inclusion: A Natural Experiment in German Hospitals,"{Digitalisation has a wide range of impacts on the workplace, such as enabling new work models with flexible work sched-ules, changing work content, or increasing workplace control. These changes directly affect not only individuals’ work but also their private lives. Scholars theorise that digitalisation either enables or impedes workers’ ability to maximise their work–life balance, which in turn fosters or inhibits the social inclusion of some societal groups and reduces or reproduces social inequalities. Focusing on the German healthcare sector, I explore the impact of using networked digital technologies on work–life balance, and whether it influences gender and educational inequalities. Pressured by government, economic concerns, and medical innovation, this sector is undergoing a transformation process that is expediting the introduction of new networked digital technologies. Thus, it provides an ideal setting for empirical investigation, as one core assumption about digitalisation is that technological innovation at work has societal consequences that must be individually mastered. To assess the relationship between digitalisation and work–life balance, I use survey data from hospital employees on the use of networked digital technologies and individual outcomes. The research is designed as a natural experiment. The treatment group comprises employees at a university hospital equipped with cutting‐edge networked digital technologies (N = 1,117); the control group comprises employees at several church‐owned hospitals (N = 415) with a level of digitalisation corresponding to the average for the sector.

Establishing standards for human-annotated samples applied in supervised machine learning - Evidence from a Monte Carlo simulation,"{Automated content analyses have become a popular tool in communication science. While standard procedures for manual content analysis were established decades ago, it remains an open question whether these standards are sufficient for the use of human-annotated data to train supervised machine learning models. Scholars typically follow a two-stage procedure to obtain high prediction accuracy: manual content analysis followed by model training with human-annotated samples. We argue that a loss in prediction accuracy in supervised machine learning builds up over this two-stage procedure. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we tested (1) human coder errors (random, individual systematic, joint systematic) and (2) curation strategies for human-annotated datasets (one coder per document, majority rule, full agreement) as two sequential sources of accuracy loss of automated content analysis. Coder agreement prior to conducting manual content analysis remains an important quality criterion for automated content analyses. A Krippendorff's alpha of at least 0.8 is desirable to achieve satisfying prediction results after machine learning. Systematic errors (individual and joint) must be avoided at all costs. The best training samples were obtained using one coder per document or the majority coding curation strategy. Ultimately, this paper can help researchers produce trustworthy predictions when combining manual coding and machine learning.}",2023,Studies in Communication and Media,"{impact of coder errors,impact of curation strategies,monte carlo simulation,prediction accuracy,supervised machine learning}",Arts and Humanities,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
"Now, later, or never? Using response-time patterns to predict panel attrition","{Preventing panel members from attriting is a fundamental challenge for panel surveys. Research has shown that response behavior in earlier waves (response or nonresponse) is a good predictor of panelists’ response behavior in upcoming waves. However, response behavior can be described in greater detail by considering the time until the response is returned. In the present study, we investigated whether respondents who habitually return their survey late and respondents who switch between early and late response in multiple waves are more likely to attrit from a panel. Using data from the GESIS Panel, we found that later response is related to a higher likelihood of attrition (AME = 0.087) and that response-time stability is related to a lower likelihood of attrition (AME = −0.013). Our models predicted most cases of attrition; thus, survey practitioners could potentially predict future attriters by applying these models to their own data.}",2023,International Journal of Social Research Methodology,"{data quality,late response,panel survey,paradata,reluctant response}",,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.242447975245918
Pre-existing company contacts and premature termination of apprenticeship training in Germany,"{Using longitudinal data from Starting Cohort 4 of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we examined whether pre-existing strong ties and weak ties in the training company are associated with the risk of premature termination of apprenticeship training in Germany. This is highly relevant for the literature on social capital in the labor market since so far little is known about the role of social contacts for the turnover propensity of labor market entrants. By examining a potentially important factor for a successful labor market integration, our research also adds to both the school-to-work and the social stratification literature. Our empirical results are only partly consistent with our theoretically derived expectations. While contrary to our expectations, we found no association between strong ties and termination probability, weak ties were, as expected, associated with a lower probability of premature training termination among those apprentices who were trained in their desired occupation. Our main results, combined with several robustness checks, let us assume that this is due to better matched training situations.}",2023,Research in Social Stratification and Mobility,"{matching quality,pre-existing company contacts,premature termination of apprenticeship training,school-to-work transition,strong and weak ties}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

We conducted an experimental study based on the German Internet Panel, a large-scale population survey that uses a probability-based sample. Based on this experiment, we show that instructions help to reduce the number of lookups to knowledge questions in web surveys. We provide further evidence that looking up answers results in more correct answers to knowledge questions and, thus, in inflated political knowledge scores. Finally, our findings illustrate the challenges and benefits of using self-reported or paradata-based lookup measures as well as a combined measure that aims at utilizing both to detect lookups to political knowledge questions in web surveys.}",2023,Public Opinion Quarterly,,,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",1.0
Disentangling the Link between Diverse Social Networks and Creativity: The Role of Personality Traits,"{Past studies have shown that being exposed to ethnocultural diversity can positively impact individual creativity. Yet, little is known about the interplay between situational (i.e., diversity) and dispositional (e.g., personality) factors in predicting creativity. Taking a person-situation approach, we use social network data to test the moderating role of personality in the relationship between having an ethnoculturally diverse network and creativity. Moreover, we investigate these questions in a diverse community sample of immigrants residing in the city of Barcelona (N = 122). Moderation analyses revealed that network diversity predicted higher levels of creativity in migrant individuals with medium to high levels of extraversion, and in those with low to medium levels of emotional stability. These results highlight the need to acknowledge the important role played by interacting individual-level dispositions and more objective meso-level contextual conditions in explaining one's ability to think creatively, especially in samples that have traditionally been underrepresented in previous literature.}",2023,Spanish Journal of Psychology,"{creativity,ethnocultural diversity,immigration,personality,social networks}",Arts and Humanities,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Evaluating an Alternative Frame for Address-Based Sampling in Germany: The Address Database From Deutsche Post Direkt,"{In Germany, the population registers with addresses of individuals can be used for address-based sampling. However, unlike countries with a centralized register, municipalities in Germany administer their registers themselves. This not only makes sampling for a nationwide survey more costly and cumbersome but may also result in gaps in the gross sample, as selected municipalities may refuse to allow their registers to be used for sampling purposes. If substitute municipalities are not available, other sampling methods are required. The present study tested the feasibility of using the address database from Deutsche Post Direkt (ADB-DPD) as an alternative frame for address-based sampling in Germany. We simultaneously conducted two almost identical surveys in the German city of Mannheim with gross samples of equal size (N = 3,000). One sample was drawn from the city’s population register, the other from the commercial ADB-DPD. Our findings suggest that the ADB-DPD performs well both in terms of survey response and up-to-dateness. Due to relatively low costs and the fast provision of addresses, the ADB-DPD could be particularly attractive for survey projects with limited budgets and tight schedules. However, these benefits come at considerable cost. First, the use of the ADB-DPD is limited to self-administered surveys. More importantly, in the net sample of the DPD survey, women and young persons were considerably underrepresented. This indicates coverage issues about which DPD provided no further information. Based on our analyses, we offer practical insights into the feasibility of using the ADB-DPD for sampling purposes and suggest avenues for future research.}",2023,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{address-based sampling,alternative sampling frame,population register,sample composition,sample evaluation}",Mathematics,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",0.04221793610854535
Left behind in a public services wasteland? On the accessibility of public services and political trust,"{Public discourse and scholars alike argue that the spatial divide in voting behavior and attitudes is rooted in geographic inequalities that serve as breeding grounds for political discontent. In previous studies, scholars have mainly focused on the economic conditions to analyze how place-based context influences the voting behavior of citizens. However, this focus on voting behavior and a small set of contextual variables do not allow us to draw direct conclusions as to how, and which, place-based factors relate to discontent on the attitudinal level. I argue that the accessibility of public service infrastructure specifically serves as a low-intensity information cue for citizens to evaluate the political performance of modern welfare states. These evaluations complement objective economic perceptions and are part of the performance-trust link. Hence, citizens should trust the government less if public services are not provided or only hard to access. I test this relationship for the German case by spatially linking the addresses of survey respondents with the location of public service facilities and collective municipallevel data. The resulting unique data set allows to explore the relationship between the accessibility of public service facilities and political trust as well as their temporal development. Results of multilevel analyses indicate that shorter distances to train stations are associated with increased trust in the government, but all other results, such as the change in service provision, remain inconclusive. The findings implicate that a long-term lack of public services contributes to geographically polarized discontent in Germany.}",2023,Political Geography,,Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.16136216729424582
The effects of data harmonization on the survey research process,"{The chapter provides a general introduction to the role of data harmonization in all aspects of the survey research process. We describe the effects of data harmonization through its evolution from a tool to standardize measures over time to a comprehensive conceptual framework that now affects all aspects of the survey research process. In the first of three parts, we cover the origins and early development of harmonization practice, especially in the context of comparative research projects. In the second part, we take a closer look at the current state of harmonization practice. We distinguish different groups of stakeholders and discuss their roles in harmonization efforts and survey research. We explore their interrelations, the implicit and explicit forms of division of harmonization labor, and the consequences for harmonization quality and efficiency. In the third part, we look toward the future, where the rise of new data types and data sources leads to new opportunities and challenges for harmonization and survey research practitioners. The focus lies on ""organic"" data, in the sense that data accumulate as a natural by-product of engaging with the current digital ecosystem.

"And if they don't dance, they are no friends of mine: Exploring boundaries of national identity","{National identity is widely used to explain anti-immigrant attitudes and thus the appeal for right-wing (populist) parties. Yet, consensus on how to capture national identity is lacking. This article identifies ideal-typical patterns of national boundary making across 42 countries and more than 25 years beyond the ethnic–civic dichotomy and addresses the multidimensionality of national identity. Using latent class analysis and cluster analysis, four ideal-typical conceptions of nationhood are identified and shown to be differently related to national attachment, national pride, and national chauvinism. Overall, the results close the methodological–empirical gap between classical approaches and recent inductive approaches to national identity and demonstrate that national identity is a cross-cultural phenomenon with distinct types.}",2023,Nations and Nationalism,"{large-scale comparison,latent class analysis,national boundary making,national identity,nationhood}",Social Sciences,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",1.0
Justice Evaluation of the Income Distribution (JEID): Development and validation of a short scale for the subjective assessment of objective differences in earnings,"{Justice evaluations are proposed to provide a link between the objective level of inequality and the consequences at the individual and societal level. Available instruments, however, focus on the subjective perception of inequality and income distributions. In light of findings that subjective perceptions of inequality and income levels can be biased and subject to method effects, we present the newly developed Justice Evaluation of the Income Distribution (JEID) Scale, which captures justice evaluations of the actual earnings distribution. JEID comprises five items that provide respondents with earnings information for five groups at different segments along the distribution of earnings in a given country. We provide a German-language and an English-language version of the scale. The German-language version was developed and validated based on three comprehensive heterogeneous quota samples from Germany; the translated English-language version was validated in one comprehensive heterogeneous quota sample from the UK. Using latent profile analysis and k-means clustering, we identified three typical response patterns, which we labeled “inequality averse,” “bottom-inequality averse,” and “status quo justification.” JEID was found to be related to normative orientations in the sense that egalitarian views were associated with stronger injustice evaluations at the bottom and top ends of the earnings distribution. With a completion time of between 1.50 and 2.75 min, the JEID scale can be applied in any self-report survey in the social sciences to investigate the distribution, precursors, and consequences of individuals' subjective evaluations of objective differences in earnings.}",2023,PLoS ONE,,Multidisciplinary,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.7515535134715665
Evaluating Transferability in Multilingual Text Analyses,"{Multilingual text analysis is increasingly important to address the current narrow focus of English and other Indo-European languages in comparative studies. However, there has been a lack of a comprehensive approach to evaluate the validity of multilingual text analytic methods across different language contexts. To address this issue, we propose that the validity of multilingual text analysis should be studied through the lens of transferability, which assesses the extent to which the performance of a multilingual text analytic method can be maintained when switching from one language context to another. We first formally conceptualize transferability in multilingual text analysis as a measure of whether the method is equivalent across language groups (linguistic transferability) and societal contexts (contextual transferability). We propose a model-agnostic approach to evaluate transferability using (1) natural and synthetic data pairs, (2) manual annotation of errors, and (3) the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique. As an application of our approach, we analyze the transferability of a multilingual BERT (mBERT) model fine-tuned with annotated manifestos and media texts from five Indo-European language-speaking countries of the Comparative Agendas Project. The transferability is then evaluated using natural and synthetic parliamentary data from the UK, Basque, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Through the evaluation of transferability, this study sheds light on the common causes that lead to prediction errors in multilingual text classification using mBERT.}",2023,Computational Communication Research,"{error analysis,large language model,multilingual text analysis,topic classification,transfer learning}",Computer Science,SS,17,"split, questionnaire, errors, machine, languages",1.0

Response Behavior and Quality of Survey Data: Comparing Elderly Respondents in Institutions and Private Households,"{An increasing age of respondents and cognitive impairment are usual suspects for increasing difficulties in survey interviews and a decreasing data quality. This is why survey researchers tend to label residents in retirement and nursing homes as hard-to-interview and exclude them from most social surveys. In this article, I examine to what extent this label is justified and whether quality of data collected among residents in institutions for the elderly really differs from data collected within private households. For this purpose, I analyze the response behavior and quality indicators in three waves of Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. To control for confounding variables, I use propensity score matching to identify respondents in private households who share similar characteristics with institutionalized residents. My results confirm that most indicators of response behavior and data quality are worse in institutions compared to private households. However, when controlling for sociodemographic and health-related variables, differences get very small. These results suggest the importance of health for the data quality irrespective of the housing situation.}",2023,Sociological Methods and Research,"{cognitive impairment,data quality,hard-to-interview,institutionalized population,retirement and nursing homes,share}",Social Sciences,SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",0.10829309158327674

Each dataset consists of the same psychometric measures for two of the Big-5 personality traits, which are expected to perform independently of sample composition. To assess the similarity of the three datasets we compare their correlation matrices, apply linear and non-linear dimension reduction techniques, and analyze the distance between the datasets. Our results show that there are important limitations when implementing a multi-item scale via a single-question river sample. We find that, while the correlation between our data sets is similar, the samples are composed of persons with different personality traits.}",2023,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{big-5,non-linear dimension reduction,non-probability sample,river sample,web survey research}",Mathematics,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",1.0

Fake News Detection in Low Resource Languages using SetFit Framework,"{Social media has become an integral part of people’s lives, resulting in a constant flow of information. However, a concerning trend has emerged with the rapid spread of fake news, attributed to the lack of verification mechanisms. Fake news has far-reaching consequences, influencing public opinion, disrupting democracy, fueling social tensions, and impacting various domains such as health, environment, and the economy. In order to identify fake news with data sparsity especially with low resources languages such as Arabic and its dialects, we propose a few-shot learning fake news detection model based on sentence transformer fine tuning, utilizing no crafted prompts and language model with few parameters. The experimental results prove that the proposed method can achieve higher performances with fewer news samples. This approach provided 71% F1 score on the Algerian dialect fake news dataset and 70% F1 score on the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) version of the same dataset, which prove that the approach can work on the standard Arabic and its dialects. Therefore, the proposed model can identify fake news in several domains concerning the Algerian community such as politics, COVID-19, tourism, ecommerce, sport, accidents and cars prices.}",2023,Inteligencia Artificial,"{algerian dialect,arabic,bert,deep learning,fake news,few-shot learning,msa,normalization,social media}",Computer Science,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.5984225870699295

We tested early bird cash incentives in a large-scale recruitment experiment for the German Internet Panel (GIP) in 2018.

Gaining Consent to Survey Respondents’ Partners: The Importance of Anchors’ Survey Experience in Self-administered Modes,"{Dyadic surveys aim to interview pairs of respondents, such as partners in a relationship. In dyadic surveys, it is often necessary to obtain the anchors’ consent to contact their partners and invite them to a survey. If the survey is operated in self-administered modes, no interviewer is present to improve the consent rate, for example, by providing convincing arguments and additional information. To overcome the challenges posed by self-administered modes for dyadic surveys and to improve consent rates, it is important to identify aspects that positively influence the likelihood of anchors giving consent to contact their partners. Ideally, these aspects are in the hands of the researchers, such as the survey design and aspects of the questionnaire. Thus, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between anchors’ survey experience and their willingness to consent to surveying their partners in self-administered modes. Based on data from the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA), we found that the anchors’ perceptions of the questionnaire as “interesting” or “too personal” were related to consent rates. These relationships were consistent across different survey modes and devices. Effects of other aspects of the questionnaire, such as “important for science” and “diverse” varied between modes and devices.

Respondents received one of two versions of a question on self-reported financial knowledge: either the original draft version, which was pretested in ten cognitive interviews, or a revised version, which was modified based on the results of the cognitive interviews. We examined whether the cognitive interviewing findings predicted problems encountered in the web survey and whether the revised question version was associated with higher content-related and criterion-related validity than the draft version. The results show that cognitive interviewing is effective in identifying real question problems, but not necessarily in fixing survey questions and improving data quality. Overall, our findings point to the importance of using iterative pretesting designs, that is, carrying out multiple rounds of cognitive interviews and also testing the revisions to ensure that they are indeed of higher quality than the draft questions.}",2023,Quality and Quantity,"{cognitive interviewing,criterion-related validity,data quality,experiment,pretesting}",,SS,28,"interviewing, performance, pretesting, machine learning, prevalence",1.0

The nexus between attitudes towards migration and the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from 11 European countries,"{The COVID-19 pandemic has a profound impact on the everyday lives of people around the world. This includes economic issues, social isolation and anxieties directly related to the coronavirus. Some of these phenomena relate to social disintegration, which in turn has been linked to negative outgroup sentiments. However, the tenuous connection between pandemic developments and international migration processes calls into question whether a link between pandemic concomitants and immigration-related attitudes exists empirically. Arguments based on political cues and media effects even suggest that the widespread focus on the COVID-19 pandemic suppresses the issue salience of immigration and negative immigration sentiments. To test these propositions, we employ data from a newly collected cross-sectional study carried out in November and December 2020 in 11 European countries. We distinguish between general migration-related threats and blaming the pandemic on immigration as outcome variables. The results suggest that pandemic-related concerns increase both threat perceptions and perceptions that immigration is driving the pandemic, but more clearly so for the latter. On the macro level, we find that where the pandemic is more severe, respondents are less likely to blame immigrants.

Harmonizing data from open-ended and closed-ended quantity questions with observed score equating,"{Many surveys ask respondents about manifest quantities, such as income, age, weight, or their height. Surveys often either use open-ended questions, where respondents report the quantity directly as an integer value (e.g., “56”), or closed-ended quantity questions where respondents select from a set of discrete interval response options (e.g., “51 to 100”). Quantity data gathered with different response schemes thus becomes hard to compare or to harmonize to be used in integrative analyses. We compare two approaches to harmonizing quantity question data. Firstly, the widely used middle of category (MOC) interpolation. Secondly, Observed Score Equating in a Random Groups Design (OSE-RG). OSE-RG is originally an approach to harmonize measures for latent constructs. However, the equipercentile OSE-RG algorithm lends itself well to quantity questions. To test the performance of both algorithms, we gathered experimental data (N = 3484) on the number of books possessed as an example quantity, where we varied the quantity-question response scheme. We show that OSE-RG often outperforms or at least matches MOC when harmonizing closed-ended questions towards an open-ended format, or when harmonizing different closed-ended response formats amongst each other. Notably, OSE-RG is also less susceptible to response biases induced by different close-ended interval response schemes.}",2023,Survey Research Methods,"{comparability,data harmonization,fair data,observed score equating}",Social Sciences,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",0.278218857427904

Based on two large-scale Web-tracking data sets, we developed indicators for routine activation and execution, tested their reliability and stability, and examined their association with the predictability of six Web use behaviors: overall Web use, news use, shopping, Facebook, YouTube, and Google use. Our results show that routine measures derived from tracking data were only moderately reliable but very stable.

These changes directly affect not only individuals’ work but also their private lives. Scholars theorise that digitalisation either enables or impedes workers’ ability to maximise their work–life balance, which in turn fosters or inhibits the social inclusion of some societal groups and reduces or reproduces social inequalities. Focusing on the German healthcare sector, I explore the impact of using networked digital technologies on work–life balance, and whether it influences gender and educational inequalities. Pressured by government, economic concerns, and medical innovation, this sector is undergoing a transformation process that is expediting the introduction of new networked digital technologies. Thus, it provides an ideal setting for empirical investigation, as one core assumption about digitalisation is that technological innovation at work has societal consequences that must be individually mastered. To assess the relationship between digitalisation and work–life balance, I use survey data from hospital employees on the use of networked digital technologies and individual outcomes. The research is designed as a natural experiment. The treatment group comprises employees at a university hospital equipped with cutting‐edge networked digital technologies (N = 1,117); the control group comprises employees at several church‐owned hospitals (N = 415) with a level of digitalisation corresponding to the average for the sector. I first discuss confounders and then employ quantitative methods to establish a link between digitalisation and work–life balance, assess its direction, and address gender and educational inequalities.}",2023,Social Inclusion,"{digitalisation,germany,healthcare,social inclusion,social inequality,work–life balance}",Social Sciences,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",0.1340368607279145
What are Researchers’ Needs in Data Discovery? Analysis and Ranking of a Large-Scale Collection of Crowdsourced Use Cases,"{Data discovery is important to facilitate data re-use. In order to help frame the development and improvement of data discovery tools, we collected a list of requirements and users’ wishes. This paper presents the analysis of these 101 use cases to examine data discovery requirements; these cases were collected between 2019 and 2020. We categorized the information across 12 ‘topics’ and eight types of users. While the availability of metadata was an expected topic of importance, users were also keen on receiving more information on data citation and a better overview of their field. We conducted and analysed a survey among data infrastructure specialists in a first attempt at ranking the requirements. Between these data professionals, these rankings were very different, excepting the availability of metadata and data quality assessment.}",2023,Data Science Journal,"{data discovery,requirements,research data,use cases}",Computer Science,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",1.0
Comparing participation motives of professional and non-professional respondents,"{In times of declining response rates and over-surveying, improving our understanding of why people participate in surveys is more important than ever. Previous research showed that online panel participants have intrinsic (e.g., topic interest, altruism) and extrinsic (e.g., incentives) participation reasons. Our study expands this research by implementing an experiment using two common forms of survey measurement: ranking and rating. The experiment was fielded in a professional respondents’ sample from a German online panel (n = 407) and in an address-based sample (mail and online) of German non-professional respondents (n = 1,137). Besides extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, the experiment included various study design features (i.e., mode, length, data security) and the mood during the time of contact as possible reasons for participation. The results confirm previous findings regarding the motivations of online panelists but also show important differences between professional and non-professional respondents. Specifically, the main participation reasons of professionals are topic interest (intrinsic) and incentives (extrinsic), while non-professionals are primarily motivated by intrinsic reasons (topic interest and purpose of study). This notion is also supported by the Latent Class Analyses, which showed that three of the four classes for professional respondents had a high probability of naming incentives as one of their main reasons for survey participation, whereas none of the four non-professional clusters rated incentives highly. The differences between the two samples highlight that professional panel members have different motivation structures than participants in general population surveys. This may undermine generalizability, but it also provides opportunities for targeted recruitment.}",2023,International Journal of Market Research,"{experiment,motivation,professional respondents,ranking vs. rating,survey participation}","Business, Management and Accounting",SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",0.1493910233016666
TSNN: A Topic and Structure Aware Neural Network for Rumor Detection,"{Detecting rumors on social media and preventing its spread play a critical role for politics, economy, etc. Conventional studies mainly focus on exploiting the content or context of the source post, while they always ignore the rich topic information within the source post. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a Topic and Structure Aware Neural Network (TSNN) for rumor detection. To be specific, we explore two kinds of topic signals, including a coarse-grained topic signal (i.e., topic credibility) and a fine-grained topic signal (i.e., latent topic representation), and tailor them to the task of rumor detection. Moreover, we introduce a new auxiliary task, i.e., topic credibility prediction, in order to effectively leverage the rich topic information within source posts. Finally, we develop a multi-task learning strategy that helps improve rumor detection performance by jointly learning the task of topic credibility prediction and user credibility prediction. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach TSNN is superior to the state-of-the-art baseline methods.}",2023,Neurocomputing,"{multi-task learning,neural topic models,rumor detection,topic credibility}",Computer Science,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.502354716278895
Using Eye-Tracking Methodology to Study Grid Question Designs in Web Surveys,"{Grid questions are frequently employed in web surveys due to their assumed response efficiency. In line with this, many previous studies have found shorter response times for grid questions compared to item-by-item formats. Our contribution to this literature is to investigate how altering the question format affects response behavior and the depth of cognitive processing when answering both grid question and item-by-item formats. To answer these questions, we implemented an experiment with three questions in an eye-tracking study. Each question consisted of a set of ten items which respondents answered either on a single page (large grid), on two pages with five items each (small grid), or on ten separate pages (item-by-item). We did not find substantial differences in cognitive processing overall, while the processing of the question stem and the response scale labels was significantly higher for the item-by-item design than for the large grid in all three questions. We, however, found that when answering an item in a grid question, respondents often refer to surrounding items when making a judgement. We discuss the findings and limitations of our study and provide suggestions for practical design decisions.}",2023,Journal of Official Statistics,"{cognitive processing,eye-tracking methodology,question design,response behavior,web surveys}",Mathematics,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",1.0
Did exposure to asylum seeking migration affect the electoral outcome of the ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ in Berlin? Evidence from the 2019 European elections,"{This article analyses the impact of exposure to asylum-seeking migration during the European ‘refugee crisis’ on votes for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland at the 2019 European elections in Berlin. While other scholars investigated the relationship between locals’ exposure to asylum-seekers and far-right voting, we analyse this relationship at a very small scale (electoral district level), adopting an innovative methodological approach, based on geo-localization techniques and high-resolution spatial statistics. Furthermore, we assess the impact on this relationship of some previously neglected variables. Through spatial regression models, we show that exposure to asylum-seeking migration is negatively correlated with AfD vote shares, which provides support for so-called ‘contact theory’ and that the relationship is stronger in better-off districts. Remarkably, the relationship is weaker in districts containing bigger reception centres, which suggests that the effects of asylum-seeking migration depend on the perceived contact intensity (and, therefore, a moderating effect of reception centre size). Finally, the effects of districts’ socio-economic deprivation on the relationship between exposure to asylum-seeking migration and AfD vote shares is different in districts located in former East and West Berlin, which suggests an effect of socio-cultural history on the relationship between exposure to migration and far-right voting.}",2023,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,"{european_elections,exposure_to_refugee_centres,far_right,germany,high-resolution_spatial_ statistics}",Arts and Humanities,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.43883799573268506
Measuring Six Facets of Curiosity in Germany and the UK: A German-Language Adaptation of the 5DCR and Its Comparability with the English-Language Source Version,"{The five-dimensional curiosity-scale revised (5DCR) by Kashdan et al. (2020) is the most comprehensive curiosity inventory available to date. 5DCR measures six facets of curiosity with four items each. Here, we present a German-language adaptation of the 5DCR and comprehensively validate this adaptation in a diverse sample of adults from Germany (N = 486). Moreover, we provide new evidence on the original English-language 5DCR in a parallel sample from the UK (N = 483). In both countries, we investigate the six facets' reliability, factorial validity, and convergent and discriminant validity with a large set of individual-differences constructs. In addition, we analyze the measurement invariance of the curiosity facets across the UK and Germany and across socio-demographic subgroups defined by age, sex, and education. Findings demonstrate that the new German-language adaptation of 5DCR and its English-language source version show psychometric properties similar to the original studies by Kashdan et al. (2020) in the United States. All six curiosity facets reach at least partial scalar invariance across cultures, sex, education, and mostly also across age groups. The findings support the six-faceted theory of curiosity and show that 5DCR allows for a valid assessment of curiosity across cultures.}",2023,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Cash Lotteries in Online Access Panels: Stating the Odds of Winning?,"{Since cash lotteries are frequently employed to stimulate participation in web surveys sampled from online access panels, the present study assesses the research gap concerning the relevance of respondents knowing their odds of winning these cash lotteries. Prior studies on the use of cash lotteries have not provided the odds of winning to respondents, which may have obscured their effects. Based on an experiment in which we varied the number of prizes, the size of prizes, and whether respondents knew the odds of winning, we replicated the findings of prior studies on the use of cash lotteries. Most importantly, our findings show that knowing the odds of winning cash lotteries did not affect the participation in our survey and did not influence the effects of other survey design elements. In our study, we provide survey practitioners with recommendations on the use of cash lotteries in online access panels and close with an outlook for future research on this topic.}",2023,International Journal of Market Research,"{cash lottery,incentives,online access panels,survey participation,web surveys}","Economics, Econometrics and Finance",SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",1.0
Disentangling stable and malleable components—A latent state-trait analysis of vocational interests,"{Although vocational interests are conceptualized as stable individual differences, their scores can contain stable components and malleable components. Using data from a 3-year-study with German adolescents (nt1 = 793, nt2 = 705, nt3 = 666), we analyzed latent state-trait models to differentiate stable components, attributable to the person, from malleable components, attributable to the occasion and/or person-occasion-interactions. Vocational interest scores contained mainly stable (latent traits), but also malleable variance (latent state residuals). Stable components reflected the theoretically posited hexagonal structure and differentiated well across interest dimensions. Malleable components shared a positive manifold across interest dimensions, also reflected the hexagonal structure, and indicated potential for additional stabilizing processes. We discuss how distinguishing the stable and malleable components enhances the understanding of vocational interest scores and their development.}",2023,Journal of Research in Personality,"{interest development,interest structure,latent state-trait theory,vocational interests}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.30831916499422973
Is there a growing use of mobile devices in web surveys? Evidence from 128 web surveys in Germany,"{Recent advances in web survey methodology were motivated by the observation that respondents increasingly use mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to participate in web surveys. Even though we do not doubt this general observation, we argue that the claim is lacking a solid empirical basis. Most research on increasing mobile device use in web surveys covers limited periods of time and/or analyzes data from only one study or panel. There is a surprising lack of comprehensive overviews on the magnitude of mobile device use in web surveys. In the present study, we explored this research gap by analyzing data from 128 web surveys collected in four different academic studies in Germany between 2012 and 2020. Overall, we found strong empirical evidence for an increase in smartphone use, a stagnation in tablet use, and a decrease in desktop PC use. There was no evidence that the increase in smartphone use will slow down any time soon. Thus, we recommend that survey researchers prepare for a device change in web surveys that may enable new applications in web surveys.}",2023,Quality and Quantity,"{mobile devices,online panels,smartphone,survey participation,web surveys}",Mathematics,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.037657193933330425

HOW DOES BACK TRANSLATION FARE AGAINST TEAM TRANSLATION? AN EXPERIMENTAL CASE STUDY IN THE LANGUAGE COMBINATION ENGLISH–GERMAN,"{When it comes to quality in questionnaire translation and hence comparability in comparative research, the chosen translation method is crucial for the outcome. Few empirical studies compare different translation methods—a fact which is often deplored in the research community. To fill the gap, in this study, the team translation approach is compared against a simple back-translation approach. The starting point in both cases was the initial English–German translations of ISSP (International Social Survey Program) questions. The final translations from both approaches were assessed, with a focus on how translation issues, such as mistranslations or wording issues identified in the initial translations were addressed. While none of the twenty-nine issues in the initial translation were present in the final team translation version, twenty-two of these issues were still present in the final version after the back-translation approach. For a selected number of items, we also ran a split-ballot experiment in a web survey. Only five out of fifteen items (33 percent) that went into the experiment showed significant differences between the translations, and only one could clearly be attributed to remaining errors in the back-translation version. In sum, the final translation from the team approach clearly outperformed the final translation from the back-translation approach when it comes to text-based criteria (in particular, accuracy and fluency). The quantitative test showed that many translation issues (those remaining in the translation after the back translation step) had no effect on the estimates. Nevertheless, we ask respondents to put effort into survey responding; in the same vein, we as researchers should put effort in the survey experience by providing questions that are clearly worded and free of errors, which puts the team approach ahead of the back-translation approach.}",2023,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{back translation,comparison of translation methods,questionnaire translation,split-ballot experiment,team translation}",Social Sciences,SS,17,"split, questionnaire, errors, machine, languages",0.959926371374695

Know What Not To Know: Users' Perception of Abstaining Classifiers,"{Machine learning systems can help humans to make decisions by providing decision suggestions (i.e., a label for a datapoint). However, individual datapoints do not always provide enough clear evidence to make confident suggestions. Although methods exist that enable systems to identify those datapoints and subsequently abstain from suggesting a label, it remains unclear how users would react to such system behavior. This paper presents first findings from a user study on systems that do or do not abstain from labeling ambiguous datapoints. Our results show that label suggestions on ambiguous datapoints bear a high risk of unconsciously influencing the users' decisions, even toward incorrect ones. Furthermore, participants perceived a system that abstains from labeling uncertain datapoints as equally competent and trustworthy as a system that delivers label suggestions for all datapoints. Consequently, if abstaining does not impair a system's credibility, it can be a useful mechanism to increase decision quality.}",2023,DIS 2023 Companion: Companion Publication of the 2023 ACM Designing Interactive Systems Conference,"{abstaining,human-centered machine learning,perception}",Computer Science,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0

Using a survey experiment in Germany, I examine the extent to which the perception of party statements changes when the respective party label and the communication medium change. I find that higher trust in the medium has a positive effect on the perception of the credibility of a party message. Furthermore, a dichotomous in-group vs. out-group divide does not reflect the complexity of a multiparty system.

How Do Internet-Related Characteristics Affect Whether Members of a German Mixed-Mode Panel Switch from the Mail to the Web Mode?,"{In recent years, several longitudinal studies have transitioned from an interviewer-administered to a mixed-mode design, using the internet as one of the modes of data collection. However, a substantial proportion of panelists are reluctant to participate in web surveys when offered a choice in an ongoing mixed-mode panel. We still know little about the characteristics of panel members that drive them to comply with the request to complete surveys via the internet. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating how internet-related characteristics are linked to the willingness of panelists to switch from the mail mode to the web. We use data from multiple waves of the GESIS Panel, a probability-based mixed-mode panel in Germany (N = 5734). A web-push intervention motivated 28% of 1364 panelists of the mail mode to complete the survey online in a single wave and 70% of these 380 short-term switchers to switch to the web mode permanently. We measured indicators of internet use, internet skills, and attitudes toward the internet as potential mechanisms of this short-term and long-term mode switching in the two waves before the intervention. Our results suggest that internet use and internet skills affect respondents’ willingness to switch modes in a single wave. For these short-term switchers, however, none of the internet-related characteristics could explain mode switching in the long term. We also present self-reported reasons by panelists for not accepting the offer to switch modes that correspond to these findings. The results of this study can be used to develop effective push-to-web methods for longitudinal mixed-mode surveys.}",2023,Social Science Computer Review,"{internet skills,internet use,mixed-mode,panel survey,web survey}",Social Sciences,SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",0.18687142947827826

Enhancing Participation in Probability-Based Online Panels: Two Incentive Experiments and Their Effects on Response and Panel Recruitment,"{This article investigates how mail-based online panel recruitment can be facilitated through incentives. The analysis relies on two incentive experiments and their effects on panel recruitment, and the intermediate participation in the recruitment survey.

Tested incentives include a conditional lottery, conditional monetary incentives, and the combination of unconditional money-in-hand with conditional monetary incentives. For an encompassing evaluation of the link between incentives and panel recruitment, the article further assesses the incentives’ implications for demographic composition and panel recruitment unit costs. Multivariate analysis indicates that low combined incentives (€5/€5) or, where unconditional disbursement is unfeasible, high conditional incentives (€20) are most effective in enhancing panel participation. In terms of demographic bias, low combined incentives (€5/€5) and €10 conditional incentives are the favored options.

Children and youth at risk in times of transition: International and interdisciplinary perspectives,"{Children and youth belong to one of the most vulnerable groups in societies. This was the case even before the current humanitarian crises around the world which led millions of people and families to flee from wars, terror, poverty and exploitation. Minors have been denied human rights such as access to education, food and health services. They have been kidnapped, sold, manipulated, mutilated, killed, and injured. This has been and continues to be the case in both developed and developing countries, and it does not look as if the situation will improve in the near future. Rather, current geopolitical developments, political and economic uncertainties and instabilities seem to be increasing the vulnerability of minors, especially in the wars and armed conflicts currently being waged not only in Europe, but on almost every continent. How can risks children and youth are exposed to in times of transition be reduced? Which role do state agencies, non-governmental organisations, as well as children's coping strategies play in mitigating the vulnerabilities of minors? This volume addresses risks to which children and young people are exposed, especially in times of transition.

Multi-label classification of open-ended questions with BERT,"{Open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. However, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. Traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. In the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. Most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. However, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. This paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. Here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. We evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the German language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES Panel (N=17,584, 55 labels). We evaluate the algorithms on 0/1 loss. We find that classification with BERT (forcing at least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered (18.9%-21.6%). Our work has important implications for social scientists: 1) Multi-label classification with BERT works in the German language for open-ends. 2) For mildly multi-label classification tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic classification. Previously, the loss was more substantial, usually requiring semiautomatic approaches. 3) Unlike the nearest competitor, ECC, multi-label classification with BERT requires only a single model for all labels.}",2023,"2023 Big Data Meets Survey Science, BigSurv 2023","{all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology}",Computer Science,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",1.0
Special elections in alternative vote electoral systems: Exploring turnout and the vote in Irish by-elections 1923–2019,"{Most literature on special elections has focused on first-past-the-post contests and on the performance of governments. Turnout, candidates, and how the electoral system impacts the result have received less attention. This contribution fills these voids by exploring special elections in Ireland, elections conducted under the alternative vote system. Taking a multifaceted approach, it investigates the correlates of turnout, the impact of candidates and the decisive effect of lower preferences, while also testing multiple explanations of government performance. I find Irish special elections live up to the by-election truisms of lower turnout and government loss. Government performance is associated with national economic conditions. By-election victory is more likely among candidates with familial lineage and former members of parliament. Where they come into play, one in five candidates owe their victory to lower preferences.}",2023,British Journal of Politics and International Relations,"{alternative vote,by-elections,government performance,ireland,special elections,turnout}",Environmental Science,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.13276640428719616
How to Detect and Influence Looking Up Answers to Political Knowledge Questions in Web Surveys,"{When answering political knowledge questions in web surveys, respondents can look up the correct answer on the Internet. This response behavior artificially inflates political knowledge scores that are supposed to measure fact-based information. In the present study, we address the existing knowledge gaps of previous research regarding looking up answers to political knowledge questions in web surveys. We conducted an experimental study based on the German Internet Panel, a large-scale population survey that uses a probability-based sample. Based on this experiment, we show that instructions help to reduce the number of lookups to knowledge questions in web surveys. We provide further evidence that looking up answers results in more correct answers to knowledge questions and, thus, in inflated political knowledge scores. Finally, our findings illustrate the challenges and benefits of using self-reported or paradata-based lookup measures as well as a combined measure that aims at utilizing both to detect lookups to political knowledge questions in web surveys.}",2023,Public Opinion Quarterly,,Arts and Humanities,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",1.0
Special Issue Introduction: The GLES Open Science Challenge 2021: A Pilot Project on the Applicability of Registered Reports in Quantitative Political Science,"{The GLES Open Science Challenge 2021 was a pioneering initiative in quantitative political science. Aimed at increasing the adoption of replicable and transparent research practices, it led to this special issue. The project combined the rigor of registered reports—a new publication format in which studies are evaluated prior to data collection/access and analysis—with quantitative political science research in the context of the 2021 German federal election. This special issue, which features the registered reports that resulted from the project, shows that transparent research following open science principles benefits our discipline and substantially contributes to quantitative political science. In this introduction to the special issue, we first elaborate on why more transparent research practices are necessary to guarantee the cumulative progress of scientific knowledge. We then show how registered reports can contribute to increasing the transparency of scientific practices. Next, we discuss the application of open science practices in quantitative political science to date. And finally, we present the process and schedule of the GLES Open Science Challenge and give an overview of the contributions included in this special issue.}",2023,Politische Vierteljahresschrift,"{2021 german federal election,electoral research,german longitudinal election study (gles),open science,quantitative political science,registered reports}",Social Sciences,SS,24,"search engines, performance, open science, political science, 2021",1.0
Counterfeits on dark markets: a measurement between Jan-2014 and Sep-2015,"{Counterfeits harm consumers, governments, and intellectual property holders. They accounted for 3.3% of worldwide trades in 2016, having an estimated value of $509 billion in the same year. Estimations in the literature are mostly based on border seizures, but in this paper, we examined openly labeled counterfeits on darknet markets, which allowed us to gather and analyze information from a different perspective. Here, we analyzed data from 11 darknet markets for the period Jan-2014 and Sep-2015. The findings suggest that darknet markets harbor similar counterfeit product types to those found in seizures but that the share of watches is higher while the share of electronics, clothes, shoes, and Tobacco is lower on darknet markets. Also, darknet market counterfeits seem to have similar shipping origins as seized goods, with some exceptions, such as a relatively high share (5%) of dark market counterfeits originating from the US. Lastly, counterfeits on dark markets tend to have a relatively low price and sales volume. However, based on preliminary estimations, the equivalent products on the surface web appear to be advertised for a multiple of the prices found for darknet markets. We provide some suggestions on how information about darknet market counterfeits could be used by companies and authorities for preventative purposes, showing that insight gathering from the dark web is valuable and could be a cost-effective alternative (or compliment) to border seizures. Thus, monitoring darknet markets can help us understand the counterfeit landscape better.}",2023,Crime Science,"{crime science,fakes,forgeries,machine learning,nlp,seized goods}",Social Sciences,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.4854406501006673
Thematic Introduction: Issue Saliency in the 2021 Federal Election,"{Germany is in a time of social upheaval. When the new ‘Traffic-Light’ coalition of SPD, Greens and FDP under the Social Democrat Olaf Scholz came to power, an era ended. The incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had been Chancellor for sixteen years, had decided not to stand for another term. The race for the chancellorship was on. While Merkel had long been accused of mainly avoiding substantive policy debates in Germany, the expectation of the 2021 federal election campaign was that it would be a fireworks display of substantive discussion. But that was only partly the case; instead the election was mainly about the candidates for Chancellor and their performance in the election campaign. Nevertheless, it was also crucial in political debates how Germany would position itself in terms of policy reforms after the Merkel era. This thematic introduction provides an insight into the role of popular issue salience in 2021 German national election and how it compared to the 2017 federal election year. It also outlines, based on a Twitter data analysis, which content-related priorities the German parties set in their digital campaigns during the federal election campaign.}",2023,New Perspectives in German Political Studies,"{candidates,election,germany,political issues,salience}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.46559901936661346
A comprehensive analysis of acknowledgement texts in Web of Science: a case study on four scientific domains,"{Analysis of acknowledgments is particularly interesting as acknowledgments may give information not only about funding, but they are also able to reveal hidden contributions to authorship and the researcher’s collaboration patterns, context in which research was conducted, and specific aspects of the academic work. The focus of the present research is the analysis of a large sample of acknowledgement texts indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. Record types “article” and “review” from four different scientific domains, namely social sciences, economics, oceanography and computer science, published from 2014 to 2019 in a scientific journal in English were considered. Six types of acknowledged entities, i.e., funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation and miscellaneous, were extracted from the acknowledgement texts using a named entity recognition tagger and subsequently examined. A general analysis of the acknowledgement texts showed that indexing of funding information in WoS is incomplete. The analysis of the automatically extracted entities revealed differences and distinct patterns in the distribution of acknowledged entities of different types between different scientific domains. A strong association was found between acknowledged entity and scientific domain, and acknowledged entity and entity type. Only negligible correlation was found between the number of citations and the number of acknowledged entities. Generally, the number of words in the acknowledgement texts positively correlates with the number of acknowledged funding organizations, universities, individuals and miscellaneous entities. At the same time, acknowledgement texts with the larger number of sentences have more acknowledged individuals and miscellaneous categories.}",2023,Scientometrics,"{acknowledged entities,acknowledgements,named entity recognition,web of science}",Computer Science,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",1.0
The Early Bird Catches the Worm! Setting a Deadline for Online Panel Recruitment Incentives,"{The literature on the effects of incentives in survey research is vast and covers a diversity of survey modes. The mode of probability-based online panels, however, is still young and so is research into how to best recruit sample units into the panel. This paper sheds light on the effectiveness of a specific type of incentive in this context: a monetary incentive that is paid conditionally upon panel registration within two weeks of receiving the initial postal mail invitation. We tested early bird cash incentives in a large-scale recruitment experiment for the German Internet Panel (GIP) in 2018. We find that panel response rates are significantly higher when offering early bird cash incentives and that fieldwork progresses considerably faster, leading to fewer reminders and greater cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, sample representativeness is similarly high with or without early bird incentives.}",2023,Social Science Computer Review,"{cost-effectiveness,incentives,online panels,probability sampling,recruitment,representativeness}",,SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",1.0

In the present study, we explored the potential of search engine data for learning about survey participation and how it can inform survey design decisions. We drew on freely available Google Trends (GT) data to learn about the use of Google Search with respect to our case study: participation in the Family Research and Demographic Analysis (FReDA) panel survey. Our results showed that some potential respondents were using Google Search to gather information on the FReDA survey. We also showed that the additional data obtained via GT can help survey researchers to discover topics of interest to respondents and geographically stratified search patterns. Moreover, we introduced different approaches for obtaining data via GT, discussed the challenges that come with these data, and closed with practical recommendations on how survey researchers might utilize GT data to learn about survey participation.}",2023,Social Science Computer Review,"{auxiliary data,digital trace data,google trends data,nonresponse,search engine data,survey participation}",Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.07942929831756078
"The Role of Public Opinion Research in the Democratic Process: Insights from Politicians, Journalists, and the General Public","{This study reveals the existence of a paradox in how the public views polling within the democratic process. Specifically, even though the public believes that it can influence policymaking, it considers public opinion polls not as useful as other, less representative forms of public input, such as comments at town hall meetings. Analyzing data from multiple surveys conducted in the United States of America, we find no evidence for the democratic representation hypothesis with respect to polling. Comparisons across stakeholders (public, journalists, and politicians) demonstrate that general perceptions of inputs into the democratic process are similar, which confirms the citizen-elite congruence hypothesis. However, unlike members of the public, experts are more likely to believe that public opinion polls are the optimal method by which the public can successfully inform policymaking, a finding consistent with the legitimization hypothesis. With respect to perceptions of politicians, we found substantial differences regarding party registration with Democrats and Independents favoring public opinion polling and Republicans preferring alternative methods (e.g., town hall meetings) of informing policymakers.}",2023,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{democratic representation,media,policymaking,politicians,preferences,public opinion research,public policy,survey value}",Decision Sciences,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",1.0
Solidarity: A European Value?,"{Solidarity is considered essential for the sustainability of societies, both at the level of individual contributions to society and as an aspect of cooperation between countries. As such, solidarity is often called upon by politicians in a declarative way. In contrast to most prior work, we investigate an attitudinal perspective on solidarity, not behavioural or policy-preference perspectives. We look at questions such as the prevalence of solidarity attitudes among European populations, the degree to which the declared norm is shared among these populations, and whether solidarity attitudes have changed with consecutive crises in Europe. We also discuss possible antecedents of solidarity levels. Distinguishing solidarity by close and universal scopes, we find that both are associated with the identification of citizens with communities at different levels. In country and time comparisons, European societies display a good degree of homogeneity and stability. Close solidarity is more pronounced than universal solidarity, and this may have even increased over consecutive crises. There are clear differences in relation to socio-historical region, but only modest associations with the religious composition of countries in terms of denominations.

Gendered Occupational Aspirations: A Comparison of Young Native-Born and Turkish Minority Women,"{Declining birth rates, an ageing population and the goal to remain globally competitive and prosperous puts pressure on the German labour market and increases the demands for greater labour force participation of women. Women with a migration background constitute a growing share of the German population, but a disproportionally lower share of the total labour force. We focused on the gender-specific occupational preferences of female adolescents with a Turkish migration background compared to those without any migration background and related these preferences to the young women’s interests, family orientations, normative gender role perceptions, and the socioeconomic status of the aspired profession in our analyses. Contrary to our expectations, our results indicate that Turkish girls less often aspire to female-dominated occupations than majority native-born girls. Instead, they prefer integrated occupations, which tend to be more prestigious and better paid. This might be mostly due to their ambitious occupational aspirations, because the gap between native-born and Turkish girls is reduced substantively after controlling for aspirations.}",2023,Methodology of Educational Measurement and Assessment,"{gender-specific occupational aspirations,migration background}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.3996911766228184

Aspiration–attainment gaps predict adolescents’ subjective well-being after transition to vocational education and training in Germany,"{An occupational aspiration–attainment gap (AAG) is defined as a discrepancy between the socioeconomic status (SES) of the aspired occupation and the one attained. We investigated how experiencing an occupational AAG after transition to vocational education and training (VET) affects three domains of subjective well-being (SWB) among adolescents in Germany (general life, job, and income satisfaction). Using longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we could track respondents’ SWB during the transition to and during VET. Results from latent growth curve models revealed that both under- and overachievement of aspirations (i.e., negative and positive AAGs) reduced initial levels of SWB after VET entry—especially work-related satisfaction (i.e., income and job satisfaction). Individuals with an AAG (both negative and positive) tended to experience a slightly larger increase in SWB during VET than those who met their aspirations. Overall, our results suggest that the decisive factor for adolescents’ SWB is not the SES of the VET position they attain, but rather whether that position is the exact type of position to which they aspired.}",2023,PLoS ONE,,Multidisciplinary,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.42498527917540285
An experimental test of the effectiveness of cognitive interviewing in pretesting questionnaires,"{Pretesting survey questions via cognitive interviewing is based on the assumptions that the problems identified by the method truly exist in a later survey and that question revisions based on cognitive interviewing findings produce higher-quality data than the original questions. In this study, we empirically tested these assumptions in a web survey experiment (n = 2,200). Respondents received one of two versions of a question on self-reported financial knowledge: either the original draft version, which was pretested in ten cognitive interviews, or a revised version, which was modified based on the results of the cognitive interviews. We examined whether the cognitive interviewing findings predicted problems encountered in the web survey and whether the revised question version was associated with higher content-related and criterion-related validity than the draft version. The results show that cognitive interviewing is effective in identifying real question problems, but not necessarily in fixing survey questions and improving data quality. Overall, our findings point to the importance of using iterative pretesting designs, that is, carrying out multiple rounds of cognitive interviews and also testing the revisions to ensure that they are indeed of higher quality than the draft questions.}",2023,Quality and Quantity,"{cognitive interviewing,criterion-related validity,data quality,experiment,pretesting}",Mathematics,SS,28,"interviewing, performance, pretesting, machine learning, prevalence",1.0

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the experiences and practices of researchers working with SMD in their research and gain insights into researchers' sharing behavior and influencing factors for their decisions. To achieve these aims, we conducted a survey study among researchers working with SMD. The questionnaire covered different topics related to accessing, (re)using, and sharing SMD. To examine attitudes toward data sharing, perceived subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, we used questions based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). We employed a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results of the qualitative analysis show that the main reasons for not sharing SMD were that sharing was not considered or needed, as well as legal and ethical challenges. The quantitative analyses reveal that there are differences in the relative importance of past sharing and reuse experiences, experienced challenges, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control as predictors of future SMD sharing intentions, depending on the way the data should be shared (publicly, with restricted access, or upon personal request). Importantly, the TPB variables have predictive power for all types of SMD sharing.}",2023,Frontiers in Big Data,"{data management,data reuse,data sharing,social media data,theory of planned behavior}",Computer Science,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",0.7405881331419841
A Spatio‐Temporal Analysis of the Urban Fabric of Nuremberg From the 1940s Onwards Using Historical Maps,"{As one of the most heavily bomb‐damaged cities in Germany, with around 90% of its historic city centre destroyed, Nuremberg (Nürnberg) provides an excellent example to investigate the urban transformation of a post‐war city. In this article, we bring together heterogeneous and under‐researched data sets and archival material from the post‐war period and convert urban features depicted in historic maps and scanned documents into digital geospatial data that is analyzed with a geographical information system. We combine morphological variables of townscape analysis to present three dif-ferent transformations over time. First, using a damage map of Nuremberg from the Second World War, we examine the varying extent of bomb damage across the city at the detailed district level. Secondly, we focus on land‐use units, compar-ing the pre‐war spatial land‐use distribution from 1940 with historical maps of land use/cover from 1956 and more recent land uses in 1969. Finally, using selected characteristics of urban form, we categorize pre‐war and present‐day urban block typologies to examine urban morphological change. In doing so, we contribute methodologically and substantively towards a new framework for the analysis of post‐war cities. We demonstrate how geographical information systems can be utilized for historical research and the study of change in urban environments, presenting a map‐based interpretation of the planning strategies to have guided post‐war urban development in Nuremberg. Providing an alternative appraisal of post‐war city transformation, our diachronic research offers insight into Nuremberg’s under‐researched past, which is also of interest to planners and policymakers seeking to improve future cities.}",2023,Urban Planning,"{city transformation,damage maps,geographical information science,post‐war planning,urban morphology}",Social Sciences,SS,19,"chapter, processes, germany, changes, political attitudes",1.0
Hard to Survey and Negligible? Institutional Populations in Europe and the Risk of Bias in Surveys Due to Their Exclusion,"{As of 2011, 1.3% of the European population were living in communal establishments such as retirement and nursing homes, university halls of residence, prisons, or refugee accommodation centers. Their small relative size, and their label as hard to survey are two reasons why many social surveys exclude institutional populations and cover only residents of private households. Using the latest European census data (2011), the present paper provides a quantitative description of these understudied groups with respect to their age, sex, marital status, citizenship, educational attainment, and labor force status. By identifying the cases in which restricting the target population to residents of private households might result in coverage bias, the paper aims to provide a basis for future decisions about the eligibility or ineligibility of institutional populations. Two components of bias are considered: the size of the respective institutional populations and differences in various demographic and socioeconomic variables. The results underline the heterogeneity of institutional populations. Due to the unequal distribution of institutional populations across age groups, I conclude that, to reduce the risk of bias, social surveys should consider extending their target populations to old-age persons living in retirement and nursing homes.}",2023,Survey Research Methods,"{coverage bias,european census data,exclusion,institutional populations,population statistics,social surveys}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.044544299250902204

HOW DOES BACK TRANSLATION FARE AGAINST TEAM TRANSLATION? AN EXPERIMENTAL CASE STUDY IN THE LANGUAGE COMBINATION ENGLISH–GERMAN,"{When it comes to quality in questionnaire translation and hence comparability in comparative research, the chosen translation method is crucial for the outcome. Few empirical studies compare different translation methods—a fact which is often deplored in the research community. To fill the gap, in this study, the team translation approach is compared against a simple back-translation approach. The starting point in both cases was the initial English–German translations of ISSP (International Social Survey Program) questions. The final translations from both approaches were assessed, with a focus on how translation issues, such as mistranslations or wording issues identified in the initial translations were addressed. While none of the twenty-nine issues in the initial translation were present in the final team translation version, twenty-two of these issues were still present in the final version after the back-translation approach. For a selected number of items, we also ran a split-ballot experiment in a web survey. Only five out of fifteen items (33 percent) that went into the experiment showed significant differences between the translations, and only one could clearly be attributed to remaining errors in the back-translation version. In sum, the final translation from the team approach clearly outperformed the final translation from the back-translation approach when it comes to text-based criteria (in particular, accuracy and fluency). The quantitative test showed that many translation issues (those remaining in the translation after the back translation step) had no effect on the estimates. Nevertheless, we ask respondents to put effort into survey responding; in the same vein, we as researchers should put effort in the survey experience by providing questions that are clearly worded and free of errors, which puts the team approach ahead of the back-translation approach.}",2023,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{back translation,comparison of translation methods,questionnaire translation,split-ballot experiment,team translation}",Mathematics,SS,17,"split, questionnaire, errors, machine, languages",0.9569770987175413

Misconceptions of earnings and their consequences for social stratification in vocational aspirations and attainment,"{This paper makes two contributions to the literature on social stratification in vocational attainment. First, we evaluate whether labour market literacy, as measured by knowledge about earnings in different occupations, is socially stratified. Second, we analyse whether differences in expected earnings between high-income and low-income occupations contribute to the social stratification in vocational aspirations and attainment using serial mediation based on data from the German National Educational Panel Study. We find that students are well informed about earnings, on average, but substantially underestimate earnings in some occupations. Students from low socio-economic status (SES) families underestimate earnings more than those from high SES families, particularly earnings in high-status occupations. Therefore, low SES students expect smaller earning differences between high-income and low-income occupations than high-SES students. In turn, small expected differences between high-income and low-income occupations are associated with lower vocational aspirations as well as attainments. Differences in expected earnings of high-income and low-income occupations mediate 4% of the differences in vocational aspirations by parental SES and 2% of the differences in vocational attainment.}",2023,Journal of Vocational Education and Training,"{information deficits,labour market literacy,social stratification,vocational and educational training,vocational aspirations}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.5382854656377635

In the second part of our study, we combined the web tracking data with data from an online survey which was answered by a subset of the tracking participants (n = 1315) to assess the relevance of various predictors of OPU that have been identified in previous research. Again, our results mostly echoed previous findings based on self-reports. Online pornography was used more by males and younger individuals, while relationship status, sexist attitudes, and social dominance orientation were not associated with OPU. However, we did find differences in OPU between members of different religious communities. Our study confirms some critical findings on OPU from previous questionnaire-based research while extending existing research by providing a more fine-grained analysis of usage patterns based on web tracking data.}",2023,Archives of Sexual Behavior,"{online pornography use,religiosity,sexism,social dominance orientation,web tracking data}",Arts and Humanities,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Indeterminism belief protects against uncertainty: first empirical findings,"{We empirically explore whether perceptions of (in)determinism are related to the willingness to tolerate uncertainty. We argue that the belief in indeterminism supports a sense of personal autonomy and independence from external influence, a stance that provides protection from perceived uncertainties. Our preliminary study (N = 61) suggests that the belief in an indeterminate world is positively associated with uncertainty tolerance, whereas beliefs in free will and metaphysical dualism are not. We extend these findings by examining proxies of indeterminism belief in a cross-national dataset (N = 31 countries). We find that greater political and personal freedom is associated with higher tolerance for uncertainty, whereas religious belief, which posits a world determined by divine powers, is negatively associated with uncertainty tolerance. With these theoretical ideas and empirical findings, we hope to stimulate research to further advance our understanding of the association between belief in indeterminism and tolerating uncertainty.}",2023,Discover Psychology,"{autonomy,causality,indeterminism,tolerance,uncertainty}",Psychology,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.11177727278177492
Bringing the political system (back) into social tipping relevant to sustainability,"{Recently, social tipping dynamics relevant to sustainability have become the subject of a growing literature. Numerous publications seek to bring the concept of tipping (back) from the natural to the social system and make important contributions to its conceptualization, definition, and constant refinement. Yet, and despite its wide array, the current literature has a blind spot: it does neither adequately integrate, conceptualize, nor measure the role of the political sphere and thus underestimates its importance for social tipping processes. This is the starting point of our contribution, which not only emphasizes the political dimension's relevance to the analysis of social tipping, but also proposes two main ways to integrate it into such analyses: by conceptualizing the political sphere either as a trigger of social tipping, or as an element that can tip itself. Moreover, to capture the complexity of the political sphere, namely the interaction between networks, actors, and processes, we suggest analysing the political sphere along its three elements: polity, politics, and policy. We illustrate the empirical benefit of these refinements by presenting a comparative case study of the nuclear phase-out in Germany and Switzerland.}",2023,Energy Policy,"{policy,political sphere,politics,polity,social tipping,tipping dynamics}",,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.1487051907654164

The emergence of preprints: comparing publishing behaviour in the Global South and the Global North,"{Purpose: The recent proliferation of preprints could be a way for researchers worldwide to increase the availability and visibility of their research findings. Against the background of rising publication costs caused by the increasing prevalence of article processing fees, the search for other ways to publish research results besides traditional journal publication may increase. This could be especially true for lower-income countries. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, the authors are interested in the experiences and attitudes towards posting and using preprints in the Global South as opposed to the Global North. To explore whether motivations and concerns about posting preprints differ, the authors adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining a quantitative survey of researchers with focus group interviews. Findings: The authors found that respondents from the Global South were more likely to agree to adhere to policies and to emphasise that mandates could change publishing behaviour towards open access. They were also more likely to agree posting preprints has a positive impact. Respondents from the Global South and the Global North emphasised the importance of peer-reviewed research for career advancement. Originality/value: The study has identified a wide range of experiences with and attitudes towards posting preprints among researchers in the Global South and the Global North. To the authors' knowledge, this has hardly been studied before, which is also because preprints only have emerged lately in many disciplines and countries.

They provide a definition of survey data harmonization and present the different approaches developed over the last decades. The authors discuss challenges faced by survey data harmonization along the survey lifecycle starting with problems of representativity, followed by the development of valid instruments and their adaptation to different contexts, fieldwork efforts including pretesting, and finally data preparation, processing, and dissemination. Additionally, the relevance of harmonization for the FAIR principles and ethical and legal aspects of harmonization are discussed.

The interplay of incentives and mode-choice design in self-administered mixed-mode surveys,"{Self-administered mixed-mode surveys are increasingly used as an alternative to face-to-face surveys for collecting data from the general population. However, little is known about how decisions regarding the incentive scheme and the mode-choice design jointly affect key outcomes such as response rates, net sample composition, and survey costs. To study this, we drew a probability sample of the residential population of the city of Mannheim, Germany (N = 2,980) and randomly assigned target persons to one of four incentive schemes (€0, €1, or €2 prepaid incentive on first contact, and €2 delayed prepaid incentive) and one of two mode-choice designs (concurrent or sequential [web-push]). Our results indicate that small prepaid monetary incentives work better in concurrent than in sequential designs. Moreover, a €2 prepaid incentive in a concurrent design proved particularly successful for older target persons, probably reinforcing their sense of trust and reciprocity, while also fitting better with their survey-mode preferences. Finally, a €2 delayed prepaid incentive in a sequential design primarily motivated target persons aged under 50 years. This combination of incentive scheme and mode-choice design also proved to be most cost-effective in that age group. Based on our results, we recommend using sampling frame information on age to address different age groups with different combinations of incentive scheme and mode-choice design. This may help to maximize response rates, achieve a balanced net sample composition, and minimize survey costs.}",2023,BMS Bulletin of Sociological Methodology/ Bulletin de Methodologie Sociologique,"{age,concurrent,delayed prepaid incentives,mixed-mode surveys,mode-choice design,prepaid incentives,sequential,survey costs,web-push surveys}",Social Sciences,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",0.07167073081959414
The Division of Routine and Non-Routine Housework Among Migrant and Native Couples in Germany,"{Gender inequality in the division of household chores is a persistent issue over time and across country contexts, while differences within and between native and migrant couples remain largely unclear. Relying on the German country case, this study examines the association between partners’ migration constellations and the division of housework. We differentiate between natives and first-generation migrants, and within first-generation migrants, we differentiate by their regions of origin. For the division of housework, we analyse traditionally female routine tasks and male non-routine tasks. Following gender and resource explanations, this study expects gendered variation in the way native, migrant, and mixed (i.e., native/ migrant) couples divide housework. Utilising novel data from the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA-GGS sample, 2021), the paper employs OLS regression models to predict the division of housework among 11,223 cohabiting different-sex couples. The study finds a gender-traditional divide in routine household tasks among migrant couples, with heterogeneity across regions of origin. Specifically, women in Asian and Eastern European couples tend to do more routine tasks than their native counterparts, while the division of routine housework in couples from Western countries is more egalitarian. In mixed couples, the division of routine tasks is highly unequal if the male partner is a migrant. Non-routine tasks in mixed couples are, however, mostly performed by the native partner, irrespective of gender. The results suggest that the division of routine housework conforms to traditional gender roles across most migrant groups, while non-routine housework, such as financial tasks that require country-specific knowledge, is influenced by the native status, which serves as a resource in itself.}",2023,Comparative Population Studies,"{couples,division of housework,freda,germany,migration}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.46671952037604675
Reversing the cumulative redundancy bias to demonstrate metacognitive flexibility in cue utilization,"{The cumulative redundancy bias (CRB) refers to people's difficulty in ignoring the redundancy in cumulatively presented information. When people consider which of two competing agents is better, they are influenced by the sequence of events that led to their accumulative total performance. If one agent was ahead most of the time, people consider this agent better – even if the agents are tied eventually. However, we show that an opposite performance-slope bias (PSB) emerges when participants focus on the performance trajectories of agents. When a trailing agent is substantially catching up to the leading agent, people judge the former as the better agent. In four experiments where we manipulated the magnitude of performance slope difference between two agents, we obtained both effects. In Experiments 1 and 2, a large slope difference between agents overshadowed other factors that may have influenced the reversal from CRB to PSB. In Experiments 3 and 4 we showed conclusively with the same design, but for different real-life contexts that the CRB emerges when the slope difference between agents is small while it reverses as the PSB when the slope difference is large.

Open-ended versus Closed Probes: Assessing Different Formats of Web Probing,"{The method of web probing integrates cognitive interviewing techniques into web surveys and is increasingly used to evaluate survey questions. In a usual web probing scenario, probes are administered immediately after the question to be tested (concurrent probing), typically as open-ended questions. A second possibility of administering probes is in a closed format, whereby the response categories for the closed probes are developed during previously conducted qualitative cognitive interviews. Using closed probes has several benefits, such as reduced costs and time efficiency, because this method does not require manual coding of open-ended responses. In this article, we investigate whether the insights gained into item functioning when implementing closed probes are comparable to the insights gained when asking open-ended probes and whether closed probes are equally suitable to capture the cognitive processes for which traditionally open-ended probes are intended. The findings reveal statistically significant differences with regard to the variety of themes, the patterns of interpretation, the number of themes per respondent, and nonresponse. No differences in number of themes across formats by sex and educational level were found.}",2023,Sociological Methods and Research,"{cognitive interviewing,embedded closed probes,open-ended questions,web probing,web survey}",Social Sciences,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",0.8298510160268504
How to Detect and Influence Looking Up Answers to Political Knowledge Questions in Web Surveys,"{When answering political knowledge questions in web surveys, respondents can look up the correct answer on the Internet. This response behavior artificially inflates political knowledge scores that are supposed to measure fact-based information. In the present study, we address the existing knowledge gaps of previous research regarding looking up answers to political knowledge questions in web surveys. We conducted an experimental study based on the German Internet Panel, a large-scale population survey that uses a probability-based sample. Based on this experiment, we show that instructions help to reduce the number of lookups to knowledge questions in web surveys. We provide further evidence that looking up answers results in more correct answers to knowledge questions and, thus, in inflated political knowledge scores. Finally, our findings illustrate the challenges and benefits of using self-reported or paradata-based lookup measures as well as a combined measure that aims at utilizing both to detect lookups to political knowledge questions in web surveys.}",2023,Public Opinion Quarterly,,Social Sciences,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",0.9325240349295567

Which factors are associated with Open Access publishing? A Springer Nature case study,"{Open Access (OA) facilitates access to research articles. However, authors or funders often must pay the publishing costs, preventing authors who do not receive financial support from participating in OA publishing and gaining citation advantage for OA articles. OA may exacerbate existing inequalities in the publication system rather than overcome them. To investigate this, we studied 522,411 articles published by Springer Nature. Employing correlation and regression analyses, we describe the relationship between authors affiliated with countries from different income levels, their choice of publishing model, and the citation impact of their papers. A machine learning classification method helped us to explore the importance of different features in predicting the publishing model. The results show that authors eligible for article processing charge (APC) waivers publish more in gold OA journals than others. In contrast, authors eligible for an APC discount have the lowest ratio of OA publications, leading to the assumption that this discount insufficiently motivates authors to publish in gold OA journals. We found a strong correlation between the journal rank and the publishing model in gold OA journals, whereas the OA option is mostly avoided in hybrid journals. Also, results show that the countries’ income level, seniority, and experience with OA publications are the most predictive factors for OA publishing in hybrid journals.}",2023,Quantitative Science Studies,"{apc policies,bibliometrics,citation impact,machine learning,open access}",Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",1.0
Establishing standards for human-annotated samples applied in supervised machine learning - Evidence from a Monte Carlo simulation,"{Automated content analyses have become a popular tool in communication science. While standard procedures for manual content analysis were established decades ago, it remains an open question whether these standards are sufficient for the use of human-annotated data to train supervised machine learning models. Scholars typically follow a two-stage procedure to obtain high prediction accuracy: manual content analysis followed by model training with human-annotated samples. We argue that a loss in prediction accuracy in supervised machine learning builds up over this two-stage procedure. In a Monte Carlo simulation, we tested (1) human coder errors (random, individual systematic, joint systematic) and (2) curation strategies for human-annotated datasets (one coder per document, majority rule, full agreement) as two sequential sources of accuracy loss of automated content analysis. Coder agreement prior to conducting manual content analysis remains an important quality criterion for automated content analyses. A Krippendorff's alpha of at least 0.8 is desirable to achieve satisfying prediction results after machine learning. Systematic errors (individual and joint) must be avoided at all costs. The best training samples were obtained using one coder per document or the majority coding curation strategy. Ultimately, this paper can help researchers produce trustworthy predictions when combining manual coding and machine learning.}",2023,Studies in Communication and Media,"{impact of coder errors,impact of curation strategies,monte carlo simulation,prediction accuracy,supervised machine learning}",Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",0.9169971752377927
"German gays go green? Voting behaviour of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals in the 2021 German federal election","{Previous analyses have shown the existence of a sexuality gap in voting behaviour between those who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB), and those who identify as heterosexual (Hertzog 1996). On the basis of these findings, it is generally assumed that LGBs vote primarily for liberal and left-wing parties because they are most likely to represent the group's interests in the political space. Using the 2021 German federal election as a case study, this article provides substantial findings, showing that, when controlled for the ideological proximity between voters and parties, sexuality affects in several ways how LGBs identify with and vote for parties in Germany. Positive effects can be demonstrated for the Greens, the Left, and – in contrast to previous assumptions – the far-right AfD.

Assessing and improving the comparability of latent construct measurements in ex-post harmonization,"{The chapter covers comparability issues that occur in many ex post harmonization projects and potential remedies. Specifically, the issue of combining data on the same latent concept measured with different survey measurement instruments is explored. Examples are measures for attitudes, values, emotions, motives, and the like, which often differ in their specific question wording or their response format. The chapter lays out the fundamental challenge of combining such source data with the aim of forming a homogenous and harmonized dataset. We propose that comparability issues and their respective remedies are best categorized into three broad issues. First, do different measurement instruments measure the same concept? This is a central consideration before pooling data from different sources. Second, do the measurement instruments have similar levels of reliability? Different question wording or response formats might also differ in how vulnerable they are to random response errors. Third, do the instruments have similar units of measurement? If we combine data from different sources into a single variable, we need to ensure that each numerical value represents a comparable concept expression (e.g. the same level of agreement), regardless of the source instrument that the data point was gathered with. For each issue, we cover a range of possible assessment methods as well as potential remedies that mitigate comparability issues. Most of the issues raised in the chapter are applicable to national and international survey data. However, harmonizing cross-cultural data adds another layer of complexity that is discussed at the end of the chapter.}",2023,Survey Data Harmonization in the Social Sciences,"{comparability,data harmonization,data quality,survey research}",,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",0.33479288924044026
Why does the trait-state relation in vocational interests differ from that in personality? Exploring interest variability in daily life,"{Recent studies further the development of trait-state models for vocational interests. Unlike personality, vocational interest states were found to vary mainly below respective trait levels. This preregistered experience-sampling study (N = 217, Nobs = 5,631) aimed to replicate and explain why the trait-state relation in vocational interests differs from personality. We tested competing assumptions about the conceptualization of interest states. Across two operationalizations using items that were (not) tailored to participants’ daily lives, interest states varied mainly below trait levels. This suggests that the distinct pattern is no measurement artifact, but that interest traits generally constrain the experience of states in daily life. Overall, the results refine the conceptualization of interest states and demonstrate that different psychological constructs meaningfully differ in their trait-state relations.}",2023,Journal of Research in Personality,"{experience sampling,interest states,intraindividual variability,personality states,trait-state relation,vocational interests}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Enhancing Participation in Probability-Based Online Panels: Two Incentive Experiments and Their Effects on Response and Panel Recruitment,"{This article investigates how mail-based online panel recruitment can be facilitated through incentives. The analysis relies on two incentive experiments and their effects on panel recruitment, and the intermediate participation in the recruitment survey. The experiments were implemented in the context of the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study and encompass two samples of randomly sampled persons. Tested incentives include a conditional lottery, conditional monetary incentives, and the combination of unconditional money-in-hand with conditional monetary incentives. For an encompassing evaluation of the link between incentives and panel recruitment, the article further assesses the incentives’ implications for demographic composition and panel recruitment unit costs. Multivariate analysis indicates that low combined incentives (€5/€5) or, where unconditional disbursement is unfeasible, high conditional incentives (€20) are most effective in enhancing panel participation. In terms of demographic bias, low combined incentives (€5/€5) and €10 conditional incentives are the favored options.

"The Role of Public Opinion Research in the Democratic Process: Insights from Politicians, Journalists, and the General Public","{This study reveals the existence of a paradox in how the public views polling within the democratic process. Specifically, even though the public believes that it can influence policymaking, it considers public opinion polls not as useful as other, less representative forms of public input, such as comments at town hall meetings. Analyzing data from multiple surveys conducted in the United States of America, we find no evidence for the democratic representation hypothesis with respect to polling. Comparisons across stakeholders (public, journalists, and politicians) demonstrate that general perceptions of inputs into the democratic process are similar, which confirms the citizen-elite congruence hypothesis. However, unlike members of the public, experts are more likely to believe that public opinion polls are the optimal method by which the public can successfully inform policymaking, a finding consistent with the legitimization hypothesis. With respect to perceptions of politicians, we found substantial differences regarding party registration with Democrats and Independents favoring public opinion polling and Republicans preferring alternative methods (e.g., town hall meetings) of informing policymakers.}",2023,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{democratic representation,media,policymaking,politicians,preferences,public opinion research,public policy,survey value}",Computer Science,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",1.0
Solidarity: A European Value?,"{Solidarity is considered essential for the sustainability of societies, both at the level of individual contributions to society and as an aspect of cooperation between countries. As such, solidarity is often called upon by politicians in a declarative way. In contrast to most prior work, we investigate an attitudinal perspective on solidarity, not behavioural or policy-preference perspectives. We look at questions such as the prevalence of solidarity attitudes among European populations, the degree to which the declared norm is shared among these populations, and whether solidarity attitudes have changed with consecutive crises in Europe. We also discuss possible antecedents of solidarity levels. Distinguishing solidarity by close and universal scopes, we find that both are associated with the identification of citizens with communities at different levels. In country and time comparisons, European societies display a good degree of homogeneity and stability. Close solidarity is more pronounced than universal solidarity, and this may have even increased over consecutive crises. There are clear differences in relation to socio-historical region, but only modest associations with the religious composition of countries in terms of denominations.

Thematic Introduction: Issue Saliency in the 2021 Federal Election,"{Germany is in a time of social upheaval. When the new ‘Traffic-Light’ coalition of SPD, Greens and FDP under the Social Democrat Olaf Scholz came to power, an era ended. The incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had been Chancellor for sixteen years, had decided not to stand for another term. The race for the chancellorship was on. While Merkel had long been accused of mainly avoiding substantive policy debates in Germany, the expectation of the 2021 federal election campaign was that it would be a fireworks display of substantive discussion. But that was only partly the case; instead the election was mainly about the candidates for Chancellor and their performance in the election campaign. Nevertheless, it was also crucial in political debates how Germany would position itself in terms of policy reforms after the Merkel era. This thematic introduction provides an insight into the role of popular issue salience in 2021 German national election and how it compared to the 2017 federal election year.

"On the creation, documentation, and sensible use of weights in the context of comparative surveys","{Dealing with weights in survey research is a bit schizophrenic: most users hope that weights will have no noticeable consequences on their analysis but, at the same time, are thinking that they have to use weights in order to obtain meaningful results. In this chapter, we discuss this paradox along different lines, in order to shed some light on an obscure area of survey analysis. We differentiate between design weights, reflecting selection probabilities, post-stratification weights, often related to non-response bias, and weights to take into account different population sizes. Our recommendations concerning weighting distinguish between computing univariate estimates and building multivariate models. More generally, in our discussion, we bring together two areas of scientific literature, not always enough related: considerations from survey statistics where the debate is very creative, and the arguments among users of survey data, where there is not always enough attention paid to best practices, in particular with respect to the Total Survey Error perspective.

To tackle these challenges, weighting adjustments have been established to correct for different inclusion probabilities and to reduce bias in the survey. These strategies adjust the survey data to match known population statistics (e.g., means and proportions). The usefulness of weighting strategies depends on the benchmarks of the variables available from official statistics or other highly reliable sources, for instance, whether population information on the weighting variables is available as joint distributions of all variables or as margins only. While complex weighting strategies have been developed for poststratification using joint distributions (for example multilevel regression and poststratification), these methods are not applicable when only population margins are available. In this paper, we propose two practical approaches that combine the multilevel regression weighting method with weighting algorithms using marginal population distributions only. In a simulation study, we applied both approaches to volunteer samples.}",2023,Communications in Statistics: Simulation and Computation,"{complex estimation,marginal population distributions,multilevel regression,weighting}",Mathematics,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.6678020076514845

Eleven strategies for making reproducible research and open science training the norm at research institutions,"{Reproducible research and open science practices have the potential to accelerate scientific progress by allowing others to reuse research outputs, and by promoting rigorous research that is more likely to yield trustworthy results. However, these practices are uncommon in many fields, so there is a clear need for training that helps and encourages researchers to integrate reproducible research and open science practices into their daily work. Here, we outline eleven strategies for making training in these practices the norm at research institutions. The strategies, which emerged from a virtual brainstorming event organized in collaboration with the German Reproducibility Network, are concentrated in three areas: (i) adapting research assessment criteria and program requirements; (ii) training; (iii) building communities. We provide a brief overview of each strategy, offer tips for implementation, and provide links to resources. We also highlight the importance of allocating resources and monitoring impact. Our goal is to encourage researchers - in their roles as scientists, supervisors, mentors, instructors, and members of curriculum, hiring or evaluation committees - to think creatively about the many ways they can promote reproducible research and open science practices in their institutions.}",2023,eLife,"{curriculum design,higher education,medicine,open science,reproducible research,scientific rigor,transparency}",,SS,20,"open science, social media, publications, training, retrieval",0.9166063541741704
Multi-label classification of open-ended questions with BERT,"{Open-ended questions in surveys are valuable because they do not constrain the respondent's answer, thereby avoiding biases. However, answers to open-ended questions are text data which are harder to analyze. Traditionally, answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. In the last 10 years, researchers have tried to automate coding. Most of the effort has gone into the easier problem of single label prediction, where answers are classified into a single code. However, open-ends that require multi-label classification, i.e., that are assigned multiple codes, occur frequently. This paper focuses on multi-label classification of text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. Here, open-ends are frequently mildly multi-label, where the average number of labels per answer text is relatively low. We evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the German language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary Relevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES Panel (N=17,584, 55 labels). We evaluate the algorithms on 0/1 loss. We find that classification with BERT (forcing at least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered (18.9%-21.6%). Our work has important implications for social scientists: 1) Multi-label classification with BERT works in the German language for open-ends. 2) For mildly multi-label classification tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic classification. Previously, the loss was more substantial, usually requiring semiautomatic approaches. 3) Unlike the nearest competitor, ECC, multi-label classification with BERT requires only a single model for all labels.}",2023,"2023 Big Data Meets Survey Science, BigSurv 2023","{all-that-apply,ecc,label powerset,open-ends,survey methodology}",Computer Science,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",0.6828552069239835
Is there a growing use of mobile devices in web surveys? Evidence from 128 web surveys in Germany,"{Recent advances in web survey methodology were motivated by the observation that respondents increasingly use mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to participate in web surveys. Even though we do not doubt this general observation, we argue that the claim is lacking a solid empirical basis. Most research on increasing mobile device use in web surveys covers limited periods of time and/or analyzes data from only one study or panel. There is a surprising lack of comprehensive overviews on the magnitude of mobile device use in web surveys. In the present study, we explored this research gap by analyzing data from 128 web surveys collected in four different academic studies in Germany between 2012 and 2020. Overall, we found strong empirical evidence for an increase in smartphone use, a stagnation in tablet use, and a decrease in desktop PC use. There was no evidence that the increase in smartphone use will slow down any time soon. Thus, we recommend that survey researchers prepare for a device change in web surveys that may enable new applications in web surveys.}",2023,Quality and Quantity,"{mobile devices,online panels,smartphone,survey participation,web surveys}",,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.03611289759899784
How Do Internet-Related Characteristics Affect Whether Members of a German Mixed-Mode Panel Switch from the Mail to the Web Mode?,"{In recent years, several longitudinal studies have transitioned from an interviewer-administered to a mixed-mode design, using the internet as one of the modes of data collection.

"Truth and Bias, Left and Right: Testing Ideological Asymmetries with a Realistic News Supply","{The debate around ""fake news""has raised the question of whether liberals and conservatives differ, first, in their ability to discern true from false information, and second, in their tendency to give more credit to information that is ideologically congruent. Typical designs to measure these asymmetries select, often arbitrarily, a small set of news items as experimental stimuli without clear reference to a ""population of information.""This pre-registered study takes an alternative approach by, first, conceptualizing estimands in relation to all political news. Second, to represent this target population, it uses a set of 80 randomly sampled items from a large collection of articles from Google News and three fact-checking sites. In a subsequent survey, a quota sample of US participants (n = 1,393) indicate whether they believe the news items to be true.

River Sampling – a Fishing Expedition: A Non-Probability Case Study,"{The ease with which large amounts of data can be collected via the Internet has led to a renewed interest in the use of non-probability samples. To that end, this paper performs a case study, comparing two non-probability datasets – one based on a river-sampling approach, one drawn from an online-access panel – to a reference probability sample. Of particular interest is the single-question river-sampling approach, as the data collected for this study presents an attempt to field a multi-item scale with such a sampling method. Each dataset consists of the same psychometric measures for two of the Big-5 personality traits, which are expected to perform independently of sample composition. To assess the similarity of the three datasets we compare their correlation matrices, apply linear and non-linear dimension reduction techniques, and analyze the distance between the datasets. Our results show that there are important limitations when implementing a multi-item scale via a single-question river sample.

Thematic Introduction: Issue Saliency in the 2021 Federal Election,"{Germany is in a time of social upheaval. When the new ‘Traffic-Light’ coalition of SPD, Greens and FDP under the Social Democrat Olaf Scholz came to power, an era ended. The incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had been Chancellor for sixteen years, had decided not to stand for another term. The race for the chancellorship was on. While Merkel had long been accused of mainly avoiding substantive policy debates in Germany, the expectation of the 2021 federal election campaign was that it would be a fireworks display of substantive discussion. But that was only partly the case; instead the election was mainly about the candidates for Chancellor and their performance in the election campaign. Nevertheless, it was also crucial in political debates how Germany would position itself in terms of policy reforms after the Merkel era. This thematic introduction provides an insight into the role of popular issue salience in 2021 German national election and how it compared to the 2017 federal election year. It also outlines, based on a Twitter data analysis, which content-related priorities the German parties set in their digital campaigns during the federal election campaign.}",2023,New Perspectives in German Political Studies,"{candidates,election,germany,political issues,salience}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.4732790333167938
A comprehensive analysis of acknowledgement texts in Web of Science: a case study on four scientific domains,"{Analysis of acknowledgments is particularly interesting as acknowledgments may give information not only about funding, but they are also able to reveal hidden contributions to authorship and the researcher’s collaboration patterns, context in which research was conducted, and specific aspects of the academic work.

Record types “article” and “review” from four different scientific domains, namely social sciences, economics, oceanography and computer science, published from 2014 to 2019 in a scientific journal in English were considered. Six types of acknowledged entities, i.e., funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation and miscellaneous, were extracted from the acknowledgement texts using a named entity recognition tagger and subsequently examined. A general analysis of the acknowledgement texts showed that indexing of funding information in WoS is incomplete. The analysis of the automatically extracted entities revealed differences and distinct patterns in the distribution of acknowledged entities of different types between different scientific domains. A strong association was found between acknowledged entity and scientific domain, and acknowledged entity and entity type. Only negligible correlation was found between the number of citations and the number of acknowledged entities. Generally, the number of words in the acknowledgement texts positively correlates with the number of acknowledged funding organizations, universities, individuals and miscellaneous entities.

Counterfeits on dark markets: a measurement between Jan-2014 and Sep-2015,"{Counterfeits harm consumers, governments, and intellectual property holders. They accounted for 3.3% of worldwide trades in 2016, having an estimated value of $509 billion in the same year. Estimations in the literature are mostly based on border seizures, but in this paper, we examined openly labeled counterfeits on darknet markets, which allowed us to gather and analyze information from a different perspective. Here, we analyzed data from 11 darknet markets for the period Jan-2014 and Sep-2015. The findings suggest that darknet markets harbor similar counterfeit product types to those found in seizures but that the share of watches is higher while the share of electronics, clothes, shoes, and Tobacco is lower on darknet markets. Also, darknet market counterfeits seem to have similar shipping origins as seized goods, with some exceptions, such as a relatively high share (5%) of dark market counterfeits originating from the US. Lastly, counterfeits on dark markets tend to have a relatively low price and sales volume. However, based on preliminary estimations, the equivalent products on the surface web appear to be advertised for a multiple of the prices found for darknet markets. We provide some suggestions on how information about darknet market counterfeits could be used by companies and authorities for preventative purposes, showing that insight gathering from the dark web is valuable and could be a cost-effective alternative (or compliment) to border seizures. Thus, monitoring darknet markets can help us understand the counterfeit landscape better.}",2023,Crime Science,"{crime science,fakes,forgeries,machine learning,nlp,seized goods}",Social Sciences,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.46425172374727175
Intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: A question of gender and parenting style?,"{“Left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. But how do political ideological attitudes emerge? One central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. However, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. Nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the European context. This paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. Hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? How does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? These questions are examined using the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and Entrepreneurship (CUPESSE) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies. First, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 European countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. Furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. The results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. It also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.}",2023,Frontiers in Political Science,"{intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.0022013447704315996
"Value orientation and external political efficacy: assessing the relationship between traditional values, progressive politics and political responsiveness","{Values are often used to explain phenomena associated with problematic political behaviours. For example, the election of far-right parties is often attributed to traditional values. The ‘Cultural Backlash’ thesis (Inglehart and Norris in Cultural backlash: trump, Brexit, and authoritarian populism. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2017a) is prominent in this field of research and explains such behaviour by a predominance of progressive issues as the result of Value Change. It is assumed that this causes traditional individuals to perceive the political system as less responsive, which can also be understood as low external political efficacy; however, there is little in the way of empirical research that tests the connection between one’s value orientation and one’s sense of external efficacy (Inglehart and Norris in Trump, Brexit, and the Rise of Populism: Economic Have-Nots and Cultural Backlash, 2016; Inglehart and Norris in Cultural backlash: trump, Brexit, and authoritarian populism, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2017a; Inglehart and Norris in Perspect Polit 15(2):443-453, 2017b). This study aims to fill this gap by examining the effects of traditional values on perceptions of external efficacy, particular attention to the role of predominantly progressive politics. For this purpose, the relationship between values and external efficacy is brought into cross-national context in order to analyse the moderating effect of the degree of progressivity of the respective national political system. To test these assumption with multilevel mixed-effects model, this study uses European Social Survey data from 23 European countries and from the Manifesto Project. The results show that traditional values are negative associated with external political efficacy. They also show that this effect is partially intensified the more progressive the party manifestos are.}",2023,Comparative European Politics,"{economic insecurity,external political efficacy,party manifesto,value change}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",1.0

The paper then develops and tests a set of hypotheses regarding the temporally dynamic relationship between EU attitudes and regions’ long- and short-term economic conditions. Our analyses reveal important longitudinal variations in this relationship with low levels of geographic differentiation in public opinion giving way to clear spatial differences in recent years. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the Great Recession and Brexit have generated a new geography of both Euroscepticism in Europe's declining regions and EU support in its wealthy and catch-up regions.}",2023,European Journal of Political Research,"{economic conditions,euroscepticism,political geography}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.05031843060069459
"The Role of Public Opinion Research in the Democratic Process: Insights from Politicians, Journalists, and the General Public","{This study reveals the existence of a paradox in how the public views polling within the democratic process. Specifically, even though the public believes that it can influence policymaking, it considers public opinion polls not as useful as other, less representative forms of public input, such as comments at town hall meetings. Analyzing data from multiple surveys conducted in the United States of America, we find no evidence for the democratic representation hypothesis with respect to polling. Comparisons across stakeholders (public, journalists, and politicians) demonstrate that general perceptions of inputs into the democratic process are similar, which confirms the citizen-elite congruence hypothesis. However, unlike members of the public, experts are more likely to believe that public opinion polls are the optimal method by which the public can successfully inform policymaking, a finding consistent with the legitimization hypothesis. With respect to perceptions of politicians, we found substantial differences regarding party registration with Democrats and Independents favoring public opinion polling and Republicans preferring alternative methods (e.g., town hall meetings) of informing policymakers.}",2023,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{democratic representation,media,policymaking,politicians,preferences,public opinion research,public policy,survey value}",Psychology,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",1.0
A Short Scale to Measure Self-Reported Aversive Personality in Political Elites,"{In order to explain the behavior of political elites, research increasingly considers personality traits. Within this line of research, a recent focus is on socially aversive–yet non-pathological–personality traits (e.g., Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy), with the idea to better understand behavior violating generally accepted ethical, moral, and social norms. Assessments of politicians’ aversive personality traits have so far been almost exclusively based on observer reports of experts and voters. Herein, by contrast, we introduce the Political Elites Aversive Personality Scale (“PEAPS”) particularly tailored to measure self-reported aversive personality among politicians. More precisely, based on two studies with German politicians, we develop a 6-item short scale comprising aspects of different socially aversive personality traits (Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and spitefulness). The scale shows an acceptable model fit, an acceptable internal consistency, an acceptable measurement equivalence, and meaningful correlations with other (self-reported) psychological traits and campaign behavior. Moreover, the scale significantly contributes to the explanation of candidates’ negative campaigning, going beyond the explanatory power of models capturing broad, basic personality traits. Overall, the suggested scale provides interesting links to research in (political) psychology and can help to explain attitudes, behavior, and performance of political elites.}",2023,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Psychology,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",1.0

Based on two large-scale Web-tracking data sets, we developed indicators for routine activation and execution, tested their reliability and stability, and examined their association with the predictability of six Web use behaviors: overall Web use, news use, shopping, Facebook, YouTube, and Google use. Our results show that routine measures derived from tracking data were only moderately reliable but very stable.

The nexus between attitudes towards migration and the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from 11 European countries,"{The COVID-19 pandemic has a profound impact on the everyday lives of people around the world. This includes economic issues, social isolation and anxieties directly related to the coronavirus. Some of these phenomena relate to social disintegration, which in turn has been linked to negative outgroup sentiments. However, the tenuous connection between pandemic developments and international migration processes calls into question whether a link between pandemic concomitants and immigration-related attitudes exists empirically. Arguments based on political cues and media effects even suggest that the widespread focus on the COVID-19 pandemic suppresses the issue salience of immigration and negative immigration sentiments. To test these propositions, we employ data from a newly collected cross-sectional study carried out in November and December 2020 in 11 European countries. We distinguish between general migration-related threats and blaming the pandemic on immigration as outcome variables. The results suggest that pandemic-related concerns increase both threat perceptions and perceptions that immigration is driving the pandemic, but more clearly so for the latter. On the macro level, we find that where the pandemic is more severe, respondents are less likely to blame immigrants. This suggests that a country-level suppression of salience of immigration is indeed taking place.}",2023,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,"{attitudes,comparative,coronavirus,covid-19,europe}",Arts and Humanities,SS,25,"risk, children, immigration, 19 pandemic, 2020",1.0
Using Double Machine Learning to Understand Nonresponse in the Recruitment of a Mixed-Mode Online Panel,"{Survey scientists increasingly face the problem of high-dimensionality in their research as digitization makes it much easier to construct high-dimensional (or “big”) data sets through tools such as online surveys and mobile applications. Machine learning methods are able to handle such data, and they have been successfully applied to solve predictive problems. However, in many situations, survey statisticians want to learn about causal relationships to draw conclusions and be able to transfer the findings of one survey to another. Standard machine learning methods provide biased estimates of such relationships. We introduce into survey statistics the double machine learning approach, which gives approximately unbiased estimators of parameters of interest, and show how it can be used to analyze survey nonresponse in a high-dimensional panel setting. The double machine learning approach here assumes unconfoundedness of variables as its identification strategy. In high-dimensional settings, where the number of potential confounders to include in the model is too large, the double machine learning approach secures valid inference by selecting the relevant confounding variables.}",2023,Social Science Computer Review,"{causal inference,gesis panel,machine learning,panel dropout,survey nonresponse}",Social Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.08370564468441283

This presents the established parties with the challenge of how to behave towards the new party. While the scholarly literature has focused more on the interaction with the populist radical right in the electoral arena, we know little about how it functions in an institutionally constrained arena such as parliament. This study asks in what way these structures affect the position taking and confrontation in speeches. Using different text-as-data approaches, I analyze parliamentary debates in four Western European parliaments after the entry of right-wing populist parties. The results show that government-opposition dynamics continue to structure parliamentary debates by and large, but right-wing populist parties succeed in polarizing debates on immigration.

We approach post‐war reconstruction not only from the mainstream actualised perspective, but also considered by alternative visions and strategies, with an emphasis on empirically driven studies of post‐catastrophic damage and reconstruction, implementing a range of different methodologies. In this editorial we identify two research strands on post‐war planning of destroyed cities, one investigating the processes and practices of reconstruction and heritage conservation and the other assessing the legacies of planning decisions on the social and urban fabric of today’s cities. These two strands are interlinked; early planning visions and subsequent decisions were dominated by contemporary concerns and political values, yet they have been imprinted on today’s urban and social fabric of various bombed cities, affecting our urban lives. Thus, reconstruction strategies of destroyed cities should engage diverse voices in a broad dialogue through sensitive inclusion, as today’s planning decisions have the capacity to define the urban and social condi-tions for future generations.}",2023,Urban Planning,"{building reconstruction,city transformation,damage maps,heritage conservation,post‐war planning,social fabric,wartime bomb damage}",Social Sciences,SS,19,"chapter, processes, germany, changes, political attitudes",1.0

First, it contains a high number of cases with more than 4,000 parent-child dyads, which come from a total of 11 European countries and thus allow a view beyond existing single country studies. Furthermore, it contains the classification of the parenting style by the children and thus enables analyses based on the perception of the recipients of the parenting rather than the parent self-assessment. The results of the analysis indicate that existing differences in political ideology between parents and children vary for cross-gender transmission processes. It also shows that the similarity of political ideology between parents and children is influenced by the parenting style, such as whether children experienced warmth from their parents, support in the pursuit of autonomy, or strong controlling behavior.}",2023,Frontiers in Political Science,"{intergenerational transmission,left-right ideology,parenting,political socialization,youth}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.0022013152309791374
"Group threat, political extremity, and collective dynamics in online discussions","{Collectives adapt their network structure to the challenges they face. It has been hypothesized that collectives experiencing a real or imagined threat from an outgroup tend to consolidate behind a few group members, and that network structures in which a few members attract most of the attention are more likely in politically extreme groups. These hypotheses have not been tested in large-scale real-world settings. We reconstruct networks of tens of thousands of commenters participating in comment sections of high-profile U.S. political news websites spanning the political spectrum from left to right, including Mother Jones, The Atlantic, The Hill, and Breitbart. We investigate the relationship between different indices of inequality of attention in commenters’ networks and perceived group threat associated with significant societal events, from elections and political rallies to mass shootings. Our findings support the hypotheses that groups facing a real or imagined outgroup threat and groups that are more politically extreme are more likely to attend to a few high-profile members. These results provide an extensive real-world test of theoretical accounts of collective adaptation to outgroup threats.}",2023,Scientific Reports,,Multidisciplinary,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",0.8164168041716586
Cognitive Reflection and Endorsement of the “Great Replacement” Conspiracy Theory,"{According to the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, mass immigration to Europe and the U.S. is part of a secret plot to replace the autochthonous White and Christian population with nonWhite and Muslim immigrants. With the aim of exploring psychological factors that play a role in believing in the “great replacement” theory, the present research focused on individual differences in reflective thinking. Using data from a cross-sectional study (N = 906), we found that cognitive reflection was negatively associated with belief in the “great replacement” conspiracy theory, even when political ideology and sociodemographic characteristics were controlled in the analysis. The findings highlight the key role of reflective thinking in countering conspiracy theories.}",2023,Social Psychological Bulletin,"{analytical cognitive style,conspiracy beliefs,great replacement,immigrants,immigration policy}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.38833894280613956
A comprehensive analysis of acknowledgement texts in Web of Science: a case study on four scientific domains,"{Analysis of acknowledgments is particularly interesting as acknowledgments may give information not only about funding, but they are also able to reveal hidden contributions to authorship and the researcher’s collaboration patterns, context in which research was conducted, and specific aspects of the academic work. The focus of the present research is the analysis of a large sample of acknowledgement texts indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. Record types “article” and “review” from four different scientific domains, namely social sciences, economics, oceanography and computer science, published from 2014 to 2019 in a scientific journal in English were considered. Six types of acknowledged entities, i.e., funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation and miscellaneous, were extracted from the acknowledgement texts using a named entity recognition tagger and subsequently examined. A general analysis of the acknowledgement texts showed that indexing of funding information in WoS is incomplete. The analysis of the automatically extracted entities revealed differences and distinct patterns in the distribution of acknowledged entities of different types between different scientific domains. A strong association was found between acknowledged entity and scientific domain, and acknowledged entity and entity type. Only negligible correlation was found between the number of citations and the number of acknowledged entities. Generally, the number of words in the acknowledgement texts positively correlates with the number of acknowledged funding organizations, universities, individuals and miscellaneous entities. At the same time, acknowledgement texts with the larger number of sentences have more acknowledged individuals and miscellaneous categories.}",2023,Scientometrics,"{acknowledged entities,acknowledgements,named entity recognition,web of science}",,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",1.0
How to Detect and Influence Looking Up Answers to Political Knowledge Questions in Web Surveys,"{When answering political knowledge questions in web surveys, respondents can look up the correct answer on the Internet. This response behavior artificially inflates political knowledge scores that are supposed to measure fact-based information. In the present study, we address the existing knowledge gaps of previous research regarding looking up answers to political knowledge questions in web surveys. We conducted an experimental study based on the German Internet Panel, a large-scale population survey that uses a probability-based sample. Based on this experiment, we show that instructions help to reduce the number of lookups to knowledge questions in web surveys. We provide further evidence that looking up answers results in more correct answers to knowledge questions and, thus, in inflated political knowledge scores. Finally, our findings illustrate the challenges and benefits of using self-reported or paradata-based lookup measures as well as a combined measure that aims at utilizing both to detect lookups to political knowledge questions in web surveys.}",2023,Public Opinion Quarterly,,Arts and Humanities,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",0.772930930668575
Left behind in a public services wasteland? On the accessibility of public services and political trust,"{Public discourse and scholars alike argue that the spatial divide in voting behavior and attitudes is rooted in geographic inequalities that serve as breeding grounds for political discontent. In previous studies, scholars have mainly focused on the economic conditions to analyze how place-based context influences the voting behavior of citizens. However, this focus on voting behavior and a small set of contextual variables do not allow us to draw direct conclusions as to how, and which, place-based factors relate to discontent on the attitudinal level. I argue that the accessibility of public service infrastructure specifically serves as a low-intensity information cue for citizens to evaluate the political performance of modern welfare states. These evaluations complement objective economic perceptions and are part of the performance-trust link. Hence, citizens should trust the government less if public services are not provided or only hard to access. I test this relationship for the German case by spatially linking the addresses of survey respondents with the location of public service facilities and collective municipallevel data. The resulting unique data set allows to explore the relationship between the accessibility of public service facilities and political trust as well as their temporal development. Results of multilevel analyses indicate that shorter distances to train stations are associated with increased trust in the government, but all other results, such as the change in service provision, remain inconclusive. The findings implicate that a long-term lack of public services contributes to geographically polarized discontent in Germany.}",2023,Political Geography,,Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.18233184377844883
Early and Late Participation during the Field Period: Response Timing in a Mixed-Mode Probability-Based Panel Survey,"{Reluctance of respondents to participate in surveys has long drawn the attention of survey researchers. Yet, little is known about what drives a respondent’s decision to answer the survey invitation early or late during the field period. Moreover, we still lack evidence on response timing in longitudinal surveys. That is, the questions on whether response timing is a rather stable respondent characteristic and what—if anything—affects change in response timing across different interviews remain open. We relied on data from a mixed-mode general population panel survey collected between 2014 and 2016 to study the stability of response timing across 18 panel waves and factors that influence the decision to participate early or late in the field period. Our results suggest that the factors which had effects on response timing are different in the mail and web modes. Moreover, we found that experience with prior panel waves affected the respondent’s decision to participate early or late. Overall, the present study advocates understanding response timing as a metric variable and, consequently, the need to reflect this in modeling strategies.}",2023,Sociological Methods and Research,"{field period,mixed-mode,panel surveys,participation,reluctant respondents,response timing}",Social Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.18518049751910545
Long-term scarring from institutional labelling: The risk of NEET of students from schools for learning disability in Germany,"{This article demonstrates the disadvantages that students leaving special needs schools (Förderschule) face in their school-to-work transition in Germany. We analyse whether the institutional label of ‘having attended a special needs school’ – beyond and above low school attainment – results in scarring effects for students’ chances of integration into training and employment after leaving school. We focus on students classified as having learning disability (Lernbehinderung), the largest group among students with special educational needs (SEN) and examine their NEET risk compared to equally low-attaining students from general schools at age 20/21. The analyses are based on rare longitudinal data for SEN students, the German National Educational Panel Study. Employing matching and regression techniques, we find that the label of ‘having attended a special needs school’ does generate long-term scars above and beyond low school attainment. However, this is only the case for school leavers with a lower secondary school certificate but not for those without school certificate.}",2023,Acta Sociologica (United Kingdom),"{educational attainment,germany,learning disability,neet,school-to-work transitions,special educational needs,vocational education and training}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.5636364824677985

SimE4KG: Distributed and Explainable Multi-Modal Semantic Similarity Estimation for Knowledge Graphs,"{In recent years, exciting sources of data have been modeled as knowledge graphs (KGs). This modeling represents both structural relationships and the entity-specific multi-modal data in KGs. In various data analytics pipelines and machine learning (ML), the task of semantic similarity estimation plays a significant role. Assigning similarity values to entity pairs is needed in recommendation systems, clustering, classification, entity matching/disambiguation and many others. Efficient and scalable frameworks are needed to handle the quadratic complexity of all-pair semantic similarity on Big Data KGs. Moreover, heterogeneous KGs demand multi-modal semantic similarity estimation to cover the versatile contents like categorical relations between classes or their attribute literals like strings, timestamps or numeric data. In this paper, we propose the SimE4KG framework as a resource providing generic open-source modules that perform semantic similarity estimation in multi-modal KGs. To justify the computational costs of similarity estimation, the SimE4KG generates reproducible, reusable and explainable results. The pipeline results are a native semantic RDF KG, including the experiment results, hyper-parameter setup and explanation of the results, like the most influential features. For fast and scalable execution in memory, we implemented the distributed approach using Apache Spark. The entire development of this framework is integrated into the holistic distributed Semantic ANalytics StAck (SANSA).}",2023,International Journal of Semantic Computing,"{apache spark,distributed computing,explainable artificial intelligence,knowledge graphs,machine learning,rdf,scalable semantic processing,semantic similarity}",Social Sciences,SS,27,"family, network, italy, united states, correlation",1.0

The emergence of preprints: comparing publishing behaviour in the Global South and the Global North,"{Purpose: The recent proliferation of preprints could be a way for researchers worldwide to increase the availability and visibility of their research findings. Against the background of rising publication costs caused by the increasing prevalence of article processing fees, the search for other ways to publish research results besides traditional journal publication may increase. This could be especially true for lower-income countries. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, the authors are interested in the experiences and attitudes towards posting and using preprints in the Global South as opposed to the Global North. To explore whether motivations and concerns about posting preprints differ, the authors adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining a quantitative survey of researchers with focus group interviews. Findings: The authors found that respondents from the Global South were more likely to agree to adhere to policies and to emphasise that mandates could change publishing behaviour towards open access. They were also more likely to agree posting preprints has a positive impact. Respondents from the Global South and the Global North emphasised the importance of peer-reviewed research for career advancement. Originality/value: The study has identified a wide range of experiences with and attitudes towards posting preprints among researchers in the Global South and the Global North. To the authors' knowledge, this has hardly been studied before, which is also because preprints only have emerged lately in many disciplines and countries.

Did exposure to asylum seeking migration affect the electoral outcome of the ‘Alternative für Deutschland’ in Berlin? Evidence from the 2019 European elections,"{This article analyses the impact of exposure to asylum-seeking migration during the European ‘refugee crisis’ on votes for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland at the 2019 European elections in Berlin. While other scholars investigated the relationship between locals’ exposure to asylum-seekers and far-right voting, we analyse this relationship at a very small scale (electoral district level), adopting an innovative methodological approach, based on geo-localization techniques and high-resolution spatial statistics. Furthermore, we assess the impact on this relationship of some previously neglected variables. Through spatial regression models, we show that exposure to asylum-seeking migration is negatively correlated with AfD vote shares, which provides support for so-called ‘contact theory’ and that the relationship is stronger in better-off districts. Remarkably, the relationship is weaker in districts containing bigger reception centres, which suggests that the effects of asylum-seeking migration depend on the perceived contact intensity (and, therefore, a moderating effect of reception centre size). Finally, the effects of districts’ socio-economic deprivation on the relationship between exposure to asylum-seeking migration and AfD vote shares is different in districts located in former East and West Berlin, which suggests an effect of socio-cultural history on the relationship between exposure to migration and far-right voting.}",2023,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,"{european_elections,exposure_to_refugee_centres,far_right,germany,high-resolution_spatial_ statistics}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.4493674062977276

Differential Racism in the News: Using Semi-Supervised Machine Learning to Distinguish Explicit and Implicit Stigmatization of Ethnic and Religious Groups in Journalistic Discourse,"{News coverage plays a crucial role in the formation of attitudes toward ethnic and religious minority groups. On the attitudinal level, it is an established notion that individuals’ explicit and implicit judgments of the same groups can vary. Yet, less is known about the prevalence of implicit group judgments in news coverage.

We use semi-supervised machine learning to distinguish explicit and implicit stigmatization of ethnic and religious groups in German journalistic coverage (n = 697,913 articles). Findings suggest that groups that are associated with less wealthy countries, and with culturally more distant countries, face more stigmatization, both explicitly and implicitly. Yet, the data also show that groups associated with Islam and groups with large refugee populations living in the country of study are implicitly, but not explicitly stigmatized in news coverage.

Intergenerational transmission of left-right ideology: A question of gender and parenting style?,"{“Left” and “right” are common concepts when it comes to describing both political attitudes of citizens and politicians or to classifying, for example, parties on the political spectrum. But how do political ideological attitudes emerge? One central factor is political socialization, in which the family is a key socialization agent. However, existing research focuses largely on partisan preferences and how they emerge through family political socialization. Nevertheless, due to multiparty systems, this concept is less suitable in the European context. This paper therefore contributes to filling this research gap by looking at the role of the family as a political socialization agent in the emergence of political ideological attitudes. Hereby the focus is on two key research questions: what difference does the cross-gender transmission of left-right ideology make? How does the parenting style affect intergenerational transmission? These questions are examined using the Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and Entrepreneurship (CUPESSE) dataset, whose structure allows for several advances on existing studies.

What does the demand for such a left-authoritarian party look like in Germany? To explore this, we examined individual-level data to understand the structural factors that cause people to rate Wagenknecht higher than her current party, The Left.

How Do Internet-Related Characteristics Affect Whether Members of a German Mixed-Mode Panel Switch from the Mail to the Web Mode?,"{In recent years, several longitudinal studies have transitioned from an interviewer-administered to a mixed-mode design, using the internet as one of the modes of data collection. However, a substantial proportion of panelists are reluctant to participate in web surveys when offered a choice in an ongoing mixed-mode panel. We still know little about the characteristics of panel members that drive them to comply with the request to complete surveys via the internet. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating how internet-related characteristics are linked to the willingness of panelists to switch from the mail mode to the web. We use data from multiple waves of the GESIS Panel, a probability-based mixed-mode panel in Germany (N = 5734). A web-push intervention motivated 28% of 1364 panelists of the mail mode to complete the survey online in a single wave and 70% of these 380 short-term switchers to switch to the web mode permanently. We measured indicators of internet use, internet skills, and attitudes toward the internet as potential mechanisms of this short-term and long-term mode switching in the two waves before the intervention. Our results suggest that internet use and internet skills affect respondents’ willingness to switch modes in a single wave. For these short-term switchers, however, none of the internet-related characteristics could explain mode switching in the long term. We also present self-reported reasons by panelists for not accepting the offer to switch modes that correspond to these findings. The results of this study can be used to develop effective push-to-web methods for longitudinal mixed-mode surveys.}",2023,Social Science Computer Review,"{internet skills,internet use,mixed-mode,panel survey,web survey}",Computer Science,SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",0.2191235208792628

HOW DOES BACK TRANSLATION FARE AGAINST TEAM TRANSLATION? AN EXPERIMENTAL CASE STUDY IN THE LANGUAGE COMBINATION ENGLISH–GERMAN,"{When it comes to quality in questionnaire translation and hence comparability in comparative research, the chosen translation method is crucial for the outcome. Few empirical studies compare different translation methods—a fact which is often deplored in the research community. To fill the gap, in this study, the team translation approach is compared against a simple back-translation approach. The starting point in both cases was the initial English–German translations of ISSP (International Social Survey Program) questions. The final translations from both approaches were assessed, with a focus on how translation issues, such as mistranslations or wording issues identified in the initial translations were addressed. While none of the twenty-nine issues in the initial translation were present in the final team translation version, twenty-two of these issues were still present in the final version after the back-translation approach. For a selected number of items, we also ran a split-ballot experiment in a web survey. Only five out of fifteen items (33 percent) that went into the experiment showed significant differences between the translations, and only one could clearly be attributed to remaining errors in the back-translation version. In sum, the final translation from the team approach clearly outperformed the final translation from the back-translation approach when it comes to text-based criteria (in particular, accuracy and fluency). The quantitative test showed that many translation issues (those remaining in the translation after the back translation step) had no effect on the estimates. Nevertheless, we ask respondents to put effort into survey responding; in the same vein, we as researchers should put effort in the survey experience by providing questions that are clearly worded and free of errors, which puts the team approach ahead of the back-translation approach.}",2023,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{back translation,comparison of translation methods,questionnaire translation,split-ballot experiment,team translation}",Decision Sciences,SS,17,"split, questionnaire, errors, machine, languages",0.8935162430769138
The emergence of preprints: comparing publishing behaviour in the Global South and the Global North,"{Purpose: The recent proliferation of preprints could be a way for researchers worldwide to increase the availability and visibility of their research findings. Against the background of rising publication costs caused by the increasing prevalence of article processing fees, the search for other ways to publish research results besides traditional journal publication may increase. This could be especially true for lower-income countries. Design/methodology/approach: Therefore, the authors are interested in the experiences and attitudes towards posting and using preprints in the Global South as opposed to the Global North. To explore whether motivations and concerns about posting preprints differ, the authors adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining a quantitative survey of researchers with focus group interviews. Findings: The authors found that respondents from the Global South were more likely to agree to adhere to policies and to emphasise that mandates could change publishing behaviour towards open access. They were also more likely to agree posting preprints has a positive impact. Respondents from the Global South and the Global North emphasised the importance of peer-reviewed research for career advancement. Originality/value: The study has identified a wide range of experiences with and attitudes towards posting preprints among researchers in the Global South and the Global North. To the authors' knowledge, this has hardly been studied before, which is also because preprints only have emerged lately in many disciplines and countries.

Enhancing Participation in Probability-Based Online Panels: Two Incentive Experiments and Their Effects on Response and Panel Recruitment,"{This article investigates how mail-based online panel recruitment can be facilitated through incentives. The analysis relies on two incentive experiments and their effects on panel recruitment, and the intermediate participation in the recruitment survey. The experiments were implemented in the context of the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study and encompass two samples of randomly sampled persons. Tested incentives include a conditional lottery, conditional monetary incentives, and the combination of unconditional money-in-hand with conditional monetary incentives. For an encompassing evaluation of the link between incentives and panel recruitment, the article further assesses the incentives’ implications for demographic composition and panel recruitment unit costs. Multivariate analysis indicates that low combined incentives (€5/€5) or, where unconditional disbursement is unfeasible, high conditional incentives (€20) are most effective in enhancing panel participation. In terms of demographic bias, low combined incentives (€5/€5) and €10 conditional incentives are the favored options. The budget options from the perspective of panel recruitment include the lottery and the €10 conditional incentive which break-even at net sample sizes of 1000.}",2023,Social Science Computer Review,"{combined incentives,demographic bias,generous lottery,incentive experiment,mobile populations,money-in-hand,prepaid cash,probability-based panel recruitment,recruitment costs}",Social Sciences,SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",0.7331914433225354
Do simpler item wording and response scales reduce acquiescence in personality inventories? A survey experiment,"{Acquiescence (“yea-saying”) presents a major challenge in personality assessment via questionnaire. Cognitive load when responding to items seems to be related to a greater tendency to acquiesce. The aim of this study was to experimentally investigate whether reducing the complexity of personality items through simplified item wording and response scales with fewer options reduces acquiesce. Based on a heterogeneous sample of almost 6000 respondents, we probed acquiescent responding on the 60-item Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) in a 2 × 2 design, comparing (a) the original items and simplified versions and (b) the original 5-point and a 4-point response scale without a midpoint. Results show that the response scale format did not affect acquiescent responding. Contrariwise, item simplification reduced the variance attributable to acquiescence in the total sample. Moderation analysis revealed stronger effects for lower-educated respondents.}",2023,Personality and Individual Differences,"{acquiescence,bfi-2,big five,education,response styles,simplification}",,SS,28,"interviewing, performance, pretesting, machine learning, prevalence",1.0

Which factors are associated with Open Access publishing? A Springer Nature case study,"{Open Access (OA) facilitates access to research articles. However, authors or funders often must pay the publishing costs, preventing authors who do not receive financial support from participating in OA publishing and gaining citation advantage for OA articles. OA may exacerbate existing inequalities in the publication system rather than overcome them. To investigate this, we studied 522,411 articles published by Springer Nature. Employing correlation and regression analyses, we describe the relationship between authors affiliated with countries from different income levels, their choice of publishing model, and the citation impact of their papers. A machine learning classification method helped us to explore the importance of different features in predicting the publishing model. The results show that authors eligible for article processing charge (APC) waivers publish more in gold OA journals than others. In contrast, authors eligible for an APC discount have the lowest ratio of OA publications, leading to the assumption that this discount insufficiently motivates authors to publish in gold OA journals. We found a strong correlation between the journal rank and the publishing model in gold OA journals, whereas the OA option is mostly avoided in hybrid journals. Also, results show that the countries’ income level, seniority, and experience with OA publications are the most predictive factors for OA publishing in hybrid journals.}",2023,Quantitative Science Studies,"{apc policies,bibliometrics,citation impact,machine learning,open access}",Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",1.0
An English-Language adaptation and validation of the Justice Sensitivity Short Scales–8 (JSS-8),"{The construct of justice sensitivity has four perspectives that capture individual differences in the strength of reactions to injustice when becoming a victim of injustice (victim sensitivity), when witnessing injustice as an outsider (observer sensitivity), when passively benefitting from an injustice done to others (beneficiary sensitivity), or when committing an injustice (perpetrator sensitivity). Individual differences in these four justice sensitivity perspectives are highly relevant in moral research. With just eight items in total, the Justice Sensitivity Short Scales–8 (JSS-8) are a very efficient way to measure the four perspectives. JSS-8 was initially constructed in German (Ungerechtigkeitssensibilität-Skalen–8, USS-8) and later translated into English. In the present study, we empirically validated this English-language adaptation in a heterogeneous quota sample from the UK. The results show that the psychometric properties (i.e., reliability, validity, standardization) of JSS-8 are good, and that they are comparable with those of the German-language source version. Because of the invariance of loadings, intercepts, and residual variances, researchers can compare manifest scale statistics (i.e., means, variances) of JSS-8 across the UK and Germany. JSS-8 is thus particularly suitable for measuring justice sensitivity in various research areas with constraints on assessment time and questionnaire space.}",2023,PLoS ONE,,Multidisciplinary,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.14387071798921433
Ethnic Differences in Social Capital Mobilization at the Transition to Vocational Training in Germany,"{In this chapter, we provide an in-depth analysis of the differences between students with and without a migration background in Germany in mobilising social capital during the transition to vocational education and training (VET) after lower secondary education. Besides retrospective information, we analyse (hypothetical) prospective information. Furthermore, we distinguish between different kinds of social contacts and different types of support. Using data from the first five waves of starting cohort 4 (9th graders) of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) we find that students rely heavily on their social contacts, with parents playing the most important role. Regarding general information and support, we find only small ethnic differences in the mobilization of non-institutional social contacts. In contrast, adolescents with a migration background tend to receive specific assistance less often from relatives outside the nuclear family and substantively less often from parents. Our results suggest that the general motivation of non-institutional social contacts to provide support at the transition to VET does not differ between natives and migrants, but that the ability of these ties to provide more specific, instrumental assistance depends on their receiving-country-specific resources and thus on their migration history.}",2023,Methodology of Educational Measurement and Assessment,"{ethnic differences,migrants,network mobilization,school-to-work transition,social capital,vocational training}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Response Quality in Nonprobability and Probability-based Online Panels,"{Recent years have seen a growing number of studies investigating the accuracy of nonprobability online panels; however, response quality in nonprobability online panels has not yet received much attention. To fill this gap, we investigate response quality in a comprehensive study of seven nonprobability online panels and three probability-based online panels with identical fieldwork periods and questionnaires in Germany. Three response quality indicators typically associated with survey satisficing are assessed: straight-lining in grid questions, item nonresponse, and midpoint selection in visual design experiments. Our results show that there is significantly more straight-lining in the nonprobability online panels than in the probability-based online panels. However, contrary to our expectations, there is no generalizable difference between nonprobability online panels and probability-based online panels with respect to item nonresponse. Finally, neither respondents in nonprobability online panels nor respondents in probability-based online panels are significantly affected by the visual design of the midpoint of the answer scale.}",2023,Sociological Methods and Research,"{nonprobability sample,online panel,probability-based sample,response quality,satisficing}",Social Sciences,SS,8,"recruitment, online panel, probability based, mixed mode, access",0.7163493005283923

Randomization tests and multidimensional scaling showed that the scores’ structural properties mirrored the RIASEC theoretical model. Scale scores were sensitive to gender differences and could predict participants’ actual and ideal occupations with reasonable hit rates. Overall, the German O*NET Interest Profiler Short Form seems apt for usage in career counseling and research settings.}",2023,Psychological Test Adaptation and Development,"{interest inventory,o*net interest profiler,riasec,vocational interests}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.31144910715521

Representativeness and face-ism: Gender bias in image search,"{Implicit and explicit gender biases in media representations of individuals have long existed. Women are less likely to be represented in gender-neutral media content (representation bias), and their face-to-body ratio in images is often lower (face-ism bias). In this article, we look at representativeness and face-ism in search engine image results. We systematically queried four search engines (Google, Bing, Baidu, Yandex) from three locations, using two browsers and in two waves, with gender-neutral (person, intelligent person) and gendered (woman, intelligent woman, man, intelligent man) terminology, accessing the top 100 image results. We employed automatic identification for the individual’s gender expression (female/male) and the calculation of the face-to-body ratio of individuals depicted. We find that, as in other forms of media, search engine images perpetuate biases to the detriment of women, confirming the existence of the representation and face-ism biases. In-depth algorithmic debiasing with a specific focus on gender bias is overdue.}",2024,New Media and Society,"{algorithm auditing,face-ism,gender bias,image search,search engines}",Social Sciences,SS,21,"modeling, detection, correlation, gender, depth",1.0
Norming Psychometric Tests and Questionnaires. A Systematic Overview for German-Language Tests,"{Except for criterion-referenced tests, norms of psychometric tests represent crucial prerequisites for comparing and interpreting test results. However, conventional norming methods-building subgroups over continuous variables (e. g., age norms)-lead to biased norms unless very large samples are collected. New continuous norming methods, such as semiparametric and parametric norming, seem to solve this economy-precision dilemma. This paper provides a systematic overview of the norming methods of German-language tests using a stratified sample of tests published after 2010 in the domains of achievement, development, intelligence, and personality. Our systematic overview shows that the applied norming practices largely comply with test standards. Where information on the norming method is provided, it shows a predominant use of conventional norming methods and a trend toward continuous norming. However, the descriptions of the norming process and the formulations of application recommendations appeared to be optimizable. Both are needed to facilitate continuous norming methods in test development.}",2024,Diagnostica,"{continuous norming,norming,psychometry,test development,tests}",Psychology,SS,14,"arguments, quality, mining, language model, artificial intelligence",0.19713916949189106

Showcasing the usefulness of web probing: Do subtle variations in questionnaire translation lead to different survey responding?,"{It is generally taken for granted that comparability in comparative research hinges, among others, on the quality of questionnaire translations. However, what do slight differences in translation mean for respondents’ answers? In this article, we look at a combination of quantitative evidence from split-ballot experiments and qualitative evidence from additional probing questions for three items that were translated according to different translation methods, resulting in different translations, e.g., for “our national way of life.” Two of the three items do not show any quantitative differences between translation versions when implemented in split-ballot experiments. However, using open-ended probing questions we delved deeper into the effects of different translation versions. This allowed us to show that different translations do indeed change respondent understanding. We suggest mechanisms that may lead to different translations (not) having an impact on the data, and we also try to align the results to the notion of equivalence/comparability in translation. Ultimately, we showcase the usefulness of web probing for exploring different translation understandings.}",2024,Quality and Quantity,"{comparability,cross-national research,questionnaire translation,split-ballot,web-probing}",Mathematics,SS,17,"split, questionnaire, errors, machine, languages",1.0
Argument Quality Assessment in the Age of Instruction-Following Large Language Models,"{The computational treatment of arguments on controversial issues has been subject to extensive NLP research, due to its envisioned impact on opinion formation, decision making, writing education, and the like. A critical task in any such application is the assessment of an argument's quality-but it is also particularly challenging. In this position paper, we start from a brief survey of argument quality research, where we identify the diversity of quality notions and the subjectiveness of their perception as the main hurdles towards substantial progress on argument quality assessment. We argue that the capabilities of instruction-following large language models (LLMs) to leverage knowledge across contexts enable a much more reliable assessment. Rather than just fine-tuning LLMs towards leaderboard chasing on assessment tasks, they need to be instructed systematically with argumentation theories and scenarios as well as with ways to solve argument-related problems.

Predicting political attitudes from web tracking data: a machine learning approach,"{Anecdotal evidence suggests that the surge of populism and subsequent political polarization might make voters’ political preferences more detectable from digital trace data. This potential scenario could expose voters to the risk of being targeted and easily influenced by political actors. This study investigates the linkage between over 19,000,000 website visits, tracked from 1,003 users in Germany, and their survey responses to explore whether website choices can accurately predict political attitudes across five dimensions: Immigration, democracy, issues (such as climate and the European Union), populism, and trust. Our findings indicate a limited ability to identify political attitudes from individuals’ website visits. Our most effective machine learning algorithm predicted interest in politics and attitudes toward democracy but with dependency on model parameters. Although website categories exhibited suggestive patterns, they only marginally distinguished between individuals with anti- or pro-immigration attitudes, as well as those with populist or mainstream attitudes. This further confirm the reliability of surveys in measuring attitudes compared to digital trace data and, from a normative perspective, suggests that the potential to extract sensitive political information from online behavioral data, which could be utilized for microtargeting, remains limited.}",2024,Journal of Information Technology and Politics,"{life-style, immigration, climate change, democracy, european union,machine learning,political attitudes,surveys,web tracking data}",Social Sciences,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",1.0

The articles offer a variety of new, rather differentiated insights into how individual-level national identity attitudes and sibling concepts like national pride, patriotism, and nationalist chauvinism are related to societal-level variables that tend to vary with exposure to aspects of globalization, such as migrant influx and economic competition. Aside from the focus on those new contributions, the introduction also offers a few observations on the challenges that the wider national identity research field still faces. Given that the field is dealing with several overlapping attitude concepts, this centrally concerns a partial lack of conceptual clarity, which sometimes translates into ambiguous operationalizations and incomplete or imprecise explication of theoretical mechanisms.

INNOVATING WEB PROBING: COMPARING WRITTEN AND ORAL ANSWERS TO OPEN-ENDED PROBING QUESTIONS IN A SMARTPHONE SURVEY,"{Cognitive interviewing in the form of probing is key for developing methodologically sound survey questions. For a long time, probing was tied to the laboratory setting, making it difficult to achieve large sample sizes and creating a time-intensive undertaking for both researchers and participants. Web surveys paved the way for administering probing questions over the Internet in a time- and cost-efficient manner. In so-called web probing studies, respondents first answer a question and then they receive one or more open-ended questions about their response process, with requests for written answers. However, participants frequently provide very short or no answers at all to open-ended questions, in part because answering questions in writing is tedious. This is especially the case when the web survey is completed via a smartphone with a virtual on-screen keypad that shrinks the viewing space. In this study, we examine whether the problem of short and uninterpretable answers in web probing studies can be mitigated by asking respondents to complete the web survey on a smartphone and to record their answers via the built-in microphone. We conducted an experiment in a smartphone survey (N= 1,001), randomizing respondents to different communication modes (written or oral) for answering two comprehension probes about two questions on national identity and citizenship. The results indicate that probes with requests for oral answers produce four to five times more nonresponse than their written counterparts. However, oral answers contain about three times as many words, include about 0.3 more themes (first probing question only), and the proportion of clearly interpretable answers is about 6 percentage points higher (for the first probing question only). Nonetheless, both communication modes result in similar themes mentioned by respondents.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{cognitive pretesting,experiment,smartphone survey,survey question design,voice recording,web probing}",Decision Sciences,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",0.4533606520888645
Family structure and children’s (non-) diverging destinies in adulthood: A decomposition approach,"{Objective: This study investigates McLanahan's diverging destinies thesis by examining whether growing up in a one-parent family is associated with individual-and aggregate-level socioeconomic inequalities in adulthood among children from different social backgrounds. Background: One-parent families are consistently viewed as a driver of socioeconomic inequalities among children from different social backgrounds. However, the outcomes of children from different social backgrounds might be differentially affected by growing up in a one-parent family. This effect heterogeneity by social background might lead to the destinies of children from different social backgrounds converging rather than diverging. Method: Drawing on data from the German Family Panel – pairfam (Wave 6, 2013/2014), this study (1) investigated the prevalence of one-parent families by social background, (2) ran ordinary least squares regression models to examine the association between growing up in a one-parent family and children's socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood (ages 29–43), and (3) employed decomposition techniques to estimate the role of one-parent families in explaining aggregate-level socioeconomic inequalities in adulthood among children from different social backgrounds. Results: Results revealed that growing up in a one-parent family is negatively associated with children's socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood on the individual level, independent of social background. On the aggregate level, however, it is not related to socioeconomic inequality in adulthood among children from different social backgrounds. Conclusion: Contrary to the predictions of the diverging destinies thesis, the findings of this study indicate that childhood family structure plays only a subordinate role in explaining aggregate-level socioeconomic inequalities in adulthood.}",2024,Journal of Family Research,"{decomposition,family,family dissolution,inequality/social stratification}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Stamp—Standardized Data Management Plan for Educational Research: A Blueprint to Improve Data Management across Disciplines,"{To provide more tailored, discipline-specific guidance on data management, Science Europe suggested the concept of domain data protocols. Based on this concept, the project Domain Data Protocols for Educational Research developed a first domain data protocol for educational research, titled Standardized Data Management Plan for Educational Research (Stamp). Its multi-level approach includes minimal conditions on managing data according to the FAIR Data Principles and checklists with concrete activities to reach each minimal condition; also included are auxiliary materials to support researchers in educational research in planning, implementing, and realizing different data management activities. Although we developed the Stamp for educational research, its design and flexible structure enables transferring it to other (research) domains and communities. To investigate this flexibility, we organized two workshops, discussing to what extent the Stamp can be used beyond educational research, with representatives from other social science domains as well as from research domains beyond the social sciences. In sum, there was consensus among participants of both workshops on the usability of the Stamp outside educational research, at least if the same types of data are processed and analyzed with similar methods. For other types of data, the Stamp serves as a blueprint to develop further domain data protocols, in terms of standardized data management plans, according to the specific needs of the respective domain.}",2024,Data Science Journal,"{(research) data management,cross-disciplinary data management,data management plans,discipline-specific guidance,domain data protocols,standardization}",Computer Science,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
Facebook as an Avenue to News: A Comparison and Validation of Approaches to Identify Facebook Referrals,"{Given that Facebook is still the most widely used social networking site in the world, its influence on democratic processes is under constant scrutiny. Academics have put a special focus on Facebook’s role in inhibiting or enhancing citizens’ news exposure. Recent studies using digital behavioral data have analyzed the prevalence and effects of “Facebook news referrals.” Using a web tracking tool that captures general browsing behavior as well as public posts seen on Facebook, this paper lays the groundwork for the field by assessing the validity of previously proposed operationalizations. We validate news referrals by investigating whether different measures actually reflect exposure to a news URL a user saw on Facebook. We furthermore assess the effects of news referrals on central outcomes in extant literature, contingent on different operationalizations. The results show that the most precise measure of news referrals are click identifiers attached to news URLs by Facebook. Different operationalizations of referrals have theoretically impactful consequences for the substantive understanding of Facebook’s role in high-choice online environments. The paper demonstrates the need for academics to constantly innovate in order to measure citizens’ online behavior in an ecologically valid manner.}",2024,Political Communication,"{data linking,facebook,news exposure,referrals,web browsing data}",Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.11641157365400581
Toeing the Party Line: Election Manifestos as a Key to Understand Political Discourse on Twitter,"{Political discourse on Twitter is a moving target: politicians continuously make statements about their positions. It is therefore crucial to track their discourse on social media to understand their ideological positions and goals. However, Twitter data is also challenging to work with since it is ambiguous and often dependent on social context, and consequently, recent work on political positioning has tended to focus strongly on manifestos (parties' electoral programs) rather than social media. In this paper, we extend recently proposed methods to predict pairwise positional similarities between parties from the manifesto case to the Twitter case, using hashtags as a signal to fine-tune text representations, without the need for manual annotation. We verify the efficacy of fine-tuning and conduct a series of experiments that assess the robustness of our method for low-resource scenarios. We find that our method yields stable positioning reflective of manifesto positioning, both in scenarios with all tweets of candidates across years available and when only smaller subsets from shorter time periods are available. This indicates that it is possible to reliably analyze the relative positioning of actors forgoing manual annotation, even in the noisier context of social media.}",2024,"EMNLP 2024 - 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Findings of EMNLP 2024",,Computer Science,SS,26,"discourse, social media, polarization, scenarios, election",1.0
What Did I Say Again? Relating User Needs to Search Outcomes in Conversational Commerce,"{Recent advances in natural language processing and deep learning have accelerated the development of digital assistants. In conversational commerce, these assistants help customers find suitable products in online shops through natural language conversations. During the dialogue, the assistant identifies the customer's needs and preferences and subsequently suggests potentially relevant products. Traditional online shops often allow users to filter search results based on their preferences using facets. Selected facets can also serve as a reminder of how the product base was filtered. In conversational commerce, however, the absence of facets and the use of advanced natural language processing techniques can leave customers uncertain about how their input was processed by the system. This can hinder transparency and trust, which are critical factors influencing customers' purchase intentions. To address this issue, we propose a novel text-based digital assistant that, in the product assessment step, explains how specific product aspects relate to the user's previous utterances to enhance transparency and facilitate informed decision-making. We conducted a user study (N=135) and found a significant increase in user-perceived transparency when natural language explanations and highlighted text passages were provided, demonstrating their potential to extend system transparency to the product assessment step in conversational commerce.}",2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"{chatbot,conversational commerce,conversational search,conversational user interfaces,explanations,product search}",Computer Science,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.0006092880715640988
How shared ties and journalistic cultures shape global news coverage of disruptive media events: the case of the 9/11 terror attacks,"{In recent decades, disruptive media events, such as major terrorist attacks, have gained increasing relevance in news coverage around the world. Despite the growing importance of such globally broadcast media events, little research to date has examined cross-national variation in event coverage or the predictors of this variation. This study examines news coverage about the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States across 51 countries to analyze whether the topical focus and emotional tone of news coverage about the attacks varied according to a country's proximity to the United States and the dominant role perceptions of its journalistic culture. We show that these macro-level predictors are associated in varying degrees with the country-level topical focus and emotional tone of reporting over the 30 days following this salient event. Moreover, our analysis also suggests that temporal developments may have uniformly structured much of this worldwide coverage.}",2024,Journal of Communication,"{computational methods,global news coverage,homophily,journalistic culture,media events}",Social Sciences,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.3564105148561829
Crossing the border: EU membership assessment by Ukrainian refugees in early 2022,"{The Russian invasion at the beginning of 2022 forced many Ukrainians to find refuge in safer places. Using unique survey data collected in the early days of the war, this research note turns to Ukrainian refugees’ opinions in two host countries: Germany and Poland. We are interested in how this–otherwise hard-to-reach und so far understudied–group of people evaluated their country’s potential European Union (EU) accession at that very specific moment in time, whether there existed differences in perceptions between the interviewees in the two countries, and what the predictors might have been. Overall, our findings indicate that the Ukrainian refugees interviewed generally supported Ukraine's accession to the EU, with no significant differences observed between the two host countries. Furthermore, both utilitarian and identity-driven factors played minor roles in shaping support for a future EU membership. These insights are not only valuable for academic research but also hold relevance for political stakeholders at both national and EU level.}",2024,Political Research Exchange,"{eu membership,germany,poland,social media sampling,ukrainian refugees}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

When your accent betrays you: the role of foreign accents in school-to-work transition of ethnic minority youth in Germany,"{Given the challenges immigrants and their descendants face in entering the labour market, we add to the existing literature by considering a previously neglected explanation: a foreign accent. Using unique data with objective accent measures from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (CILS4EU), we first establish whether foreign-accent effects could be found in a non-experimental setting. Second, we seek to disentangle the accent effect by human capital, signalling, and discrimination approaches. Finally, we explore the extent to which employment and educational paths of accented speakers reflect their self-selection into the fields of study that lead to occupations for which accented speech is not a precondition. Our findings demonstrate that respondents with a stronger foreign accent are more likely to be found in occupations for which language skills are less essential. This is in line with the human-capital explanation. Self-selection tendencies might also be present, even though the findings are equivocal. Our analyses lend no support to the statistical discrimination explanation, as employers’ perceptions of foreign accents do not vary according to the extent of their contact with accented speakers at work or at home.}",2024,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,"{accent,immigrants,integration,labour market entry,school-to-work transition}",Arts and Humanities,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Linguistic feature fusion for Arabic fake news detection and named entity recognition using reinforcement learning and swarm optimization,"{In the context of the escalating use of social media in Arabic-speaking countries, driven by improved internet access, affordable smartphones, and a growing digital connectivity trend, this study addresses a significant challenge: the widespread dissemination of fake news. The ease and rapidity of spreading information on social media, coupled with a lack of stringent fact-checking measures, exacerbate the issue of misinformation. Our study examines how language features, especially Named Entity Recognition (NER) features, play a role in detecting fake news. We built two models: an AraBERT Multi-task Learning (MTL) based one for classifying Arabic fake news, and a token classification model that focuses on fake news NER features. The study combines embedding vectors from these models using an embedding fusion technique and applies machine learning algorithms for fake news detection in Arabic. We also introduced a feature selection algorithm named RLTTAO based on improving the Triangulation Topology Aggregation Optimizer (TTAO) performance using Reinforcement Learning and random opposition-based learning to enhance the performance by selecting relevant features, thereby improving the fusion process. Our results show that incorporating NER features enhances the accuracy of fake news detection in 5 out of 7 datasets, with an average improvement of 1.62%.}",2024,Neurocomputing,"{arabic fake news detection,deep learning,linguistic feature fusion,named entity recognition,reinforcement learning,swarm optimization}",Computer Science,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.8829298903530438

Panel Conditioning in A Probability-based Longitudinal study: A Comparison of Respondents with Different Levels of Survey Experience,"{Learning effects due to repeated interviewing, also known as panel conditioning, are a major threat to response quality in later waves of a panel study. To date, research has not provided a clear picture regarding the circumstances, mechanisms, and dimensions of potential panel conditioning effects. In particular, the effects of conditioning frequency, that is, different levels of experience within a panel, on response quality are underexplored. Against this background, we investigated the effects of panel conditioning by using data from the GESIS Panel, a German mixed-mode probability-based panel study. Using two refreshment samples, we compared three panel cohorts with differing levels of experience on several response quality indicators related to the mechanisms of reflection, satisficing, and social desirability. Overall, we find evidence for both negative (i.e., disadvantageous for response quality) and positive (i.e., advantageous for response quality) panel conditioning. Highly experienced respondents were more likely to satisfice by speeding through the questionnaire. They also had a higher probability of refusing to answer sensitive questions than less experienced panel members. However, more experienced respondents were also more likely to optimize the response process by needing less time compared to panelists with lower experience levels (when controlling for speeding). In contrast, we did not find significant differences with respect to the number of ""don't know""responses, nondifferentiation, the selection of first response categories and mid-responses, and the number of nontriggered filter questions. Of the observed differences, speeding showed the highest magnitude with an average increase of 6.0 percentage points for highly experienced panel members compared to low experienced panelists.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{data quality,longitudinal surveys,panel conditioning,probability-based panel study}",Mathematics,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",1.0
Online Disinformation Predicts Inaccurate Beliefs About Election Fairness Among Both Winners and Losers,"{Electoral disinformation is feared to variously undermine democratic trust by inflaming incorrect negative beliefs about the fairness of elections, or to shore up dictators by creating falsely positive ones. Recent studies of political misperceptions, however, suggest that disinformation has at best minimal effects on beliefs. In this article, we investigate the drivers of public perceptions and misperceptions of election fairness. We build on theories of rational belief updating and motivated reasoning, and link public opinion data from 82 national elections with expert survey data on disinformation and de facto electoral integrity. We show that, overall, people arrive at largely accurate perceptions, but that disinformation campaigns are indeed associated with less accurate and more polarized beliefs about election fairness. This contributes a cross-nationally comparative perspective to studies of (dis)information processing and belief updating, as well as attitude formation and trust surrounding highly salient political institutions such as elections.}",2024,Comparative Political Studies,"{bayesian updating,disinformation,electoral integrity,misperceptions,motivated reasoning}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.19996133749484812
Aspects of Utilization of Psychotherapy in Germany in Times of the GDR and Later,"{Objective The aim of the study was to examine real differences in the use of psychotherapy in the New Federal States during the GDR era and today. In addition, differences according to the willingness seeking psychotherapy as well as barriers in opinions and contact to the mentally ill between people from the New Federal States, the Old Federal States and people who moved from the New Federal States to the Old Federal States (internal migrants) should be recorded, taking into account generational effects (experience of the Cold War - birth before / after January 1 st, 1980). Methods To investigate these questions, the data from a representative survey in the New Federal States of N=2729 people as well as the data from a second online based survey of people from the New and Old Federal States as well as internal migrants with a total of N=4789 participants were evaluated. Results There was a prevalence of 1% for the use of psychotherapy during the GDR era. Overall, the prevalence of therapy experiences among people who experienced the GDR and were born before January 1 st in 1980 was almost 13%. They also reported greater willingness seeking help for mental suffering since the end of the Cold War. The prevalence among younger people was about 12%. In the second survey, there were significant differences, among the older respondents. East Germans today and even during the GDR era were less willing to seek psychotherapy for mental suffering, they also have less contact to mentally ill people. Differences according to desires for distance from mentally ill people, self stigmatization in the presence of a mental illness and discrimination against mentally ill people emerged between East Germans, West Germans and internal migrants depending on generational affiliation. Discussion Barriers that prevent the use of psychotherapy should be taken into account on a generational and socialization specific basis. Socialization as a relevant factor might explain a lack of willingness to utilize psychotherapy amongst people that experienced the GDR era and still live in the new Federal States.}",2024,PPmP Psychotherapie Psychosomatik Medizinische Psychologie,"{gdr,helpseeking,psychotherapy}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images,"{Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052 % were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.}",2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"{ai-generated content,fake image detection,social networks}",Computer Science,SS,21,"modeling, detection, correlation, gender, depth",1.0

Automatic Analysis of Political Debates and Manifestos: Successes and Challenges,"{The opinions of political actors (e.g., politicians, parties, organizations) expressed through claims are the core elements of political debates and decision-making. Political actors communicate through different channels: parties publish manifestos for major elections, while individual actors make statements on a day-to-day basis as reflected in the media. These two channels offer different approaches for analysis: Manifestos, on the one hand, are useful to characterize the parties’ positions at a global ideological level over time. In contrast, individual statements can be collected to analyze debates in particular policy domains on a fine-grained level, in terms of individual actors and claims. In this article, we summarize a series of studies we have carried out. We apply NLP-driven (semi-)automatic analyses on these two channels and compare their potentials and challenges. The fine-grained analysis yields rich insights into the communication but comes at the cost of three challenges: (a) a substantial hunger for manual annotation, introducing practical hurdles for analysis both within and across languages; (b) difficulties in claim classification arising from the uneven frequency distribution over the theory-based annotation schemas; (c) the need to map actor mentions onto canonical versions. Manifesto-based analysis avoids these challenges to a substantial extent when a more coarse-grained analysis of party positions is sufficient. We highlight the benefits and challenges of both approaches, and conclude by outlining perspectives for addressing the challenges in future research.}",2024,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),"{argument mining,claim identification,discourse network analysis,party positioning}",Mathematics,SS,26,"discourse, social media, polarization, scenarios, election",1.0
Showcasing the usefulness of web probing: Do subtle variations in questionnaire translation lead to different survey responding?,"{It is generally taken for granted that comparability in comparative research hinges, among others, on the quality of questionnaire translations. However, what do slight differences in translation mean for respondents’ answers? In this article, we look at a combination of quantitative evidence from split-ballot experiments and qualitative evidence from additional probing questions for three items that were translated according to different translation methods, resulting in different translations, e.g., for “our national way of life.” Two of the three items do not show any quantitative differences between translation versions when implemented in split-ballot experiments. However, using open-ended probing questions we delved deeper into the effects of different translation versions. This allowed us to show that different translations do indeed change respondent understanding. We suggest mechanisms that may lead to different translations (not) having an impact on the data, and we also try to align the results to the notion of equivalence/comparability in translation. Ultimately, we showcase the usefulness of web probing for exploring different translation understandings.}",2024,Quality and Quantity,"{comparability,cross-national research,questionnaire translation,split-ballot,web-probing}",,SS,17,"split, questionnaire, errors, machine, languages",1.0

How does information affect vote choice in open-list PR systems? Evidence from a survey experiment mimicking real-world elections in Switzerland,"{List proportional representation with candidate voting can facilitate policy representation in multiple dimensions. However, candidates with deviating positions may not benefit if cues such as shared socio-demographics drive candidate choice instead. Does this use of cues reflect a lack of policy-related information or a preference for descriptive representation? We study this question in a real-world context, using a survey-embedded experiment that emulates actual vote choice shortly after the 2019 Swiss elections. We vary the level of information on candidates’ policy positions in zero, one or two dimensions (left–right, environment). Our results show that spatial proximity voting increases with better information on the secondary (but not the first) dimension, indicating that information can improve the alignment of (environmental) policy views between voters and candidates. In turn, same-gender and same-age voting slightly decreases when more information is available. The preference for local candidates remains strong.

The ethnic penalty in welfare deservingness: A factorial survey experiment on welfare chauvinism in pension attitudes in Germany,"{This study investigates whether pensioners with a foreign ethnic background are perceived as less deserving to receive a pension than are native pensioners. It focuses on Germany as an example with a strongly achievement-oriented social insurance system which closely links benefits to previous contributions. Hence, the system prevents a citizen from receiving benefits without having contributed. Our study thus adds to existing research by examining a less likely case to find welfare chauvinistic attitudes. To test our expectations, we rely on a factorial survey design and a probability sample of the German population in 2019. Survey respondents decide on the amount of pension benefits that a hypothetical pensioner should receive. Characteristics of the hypothetical pensioner – ethnic background, gender, last income, contribution years, the number of children and other dependents – are randomly varied. Our study finds support for welfare chauvinist attitudes in an achievement-oriented social insurance system. Even for the same achievement, that is, same income, contribution years and number of children, natives grant lower pensions to pensioners with a foreign ethnic background than to natives. Also, even if migrants show the most favourable behaviour (that is, having contributed to the pension system for many years and with a high income), the ethnic penalty in pensions remains significant.}",2024,Journal of European Social Policy,"{deservingness,factorial survey experiment,pensions,welfare chauvinism}",Environmental Science,SS,23,"european, governance, crises, attitudes, levels",0.9762950091581257

Novelty in News Search: A Longitudinal Study of the 2020 US Elections,"{The 2020 US elections news coverage was extensive, with new pieces of information generated rapidly. This evolving scenario presented an opportunity to study the performance of search engines in a context in which they had to quickly process information as it was published. We analyze novelty, a measurement of new items that emerge in the top news search results, to compare the coverage and visibility of different topics. Using virtual agents that simulate human web browsing behavior to collect search engine result pages, we conduct a longitudinal study of news results of five search engines collected in short bursts (every 21 minutes) from two regions (Oregon, US and Frankfurt, Germany), starting on election day and lasting until one day after the announcement of Biden as the winner. We find more new items emerging for election related queries (“joe biden,” “donald trump,” and “us elections”) compared to topical (e.g., “coronavirus”) or stable (e.g., “holocaust”) queries. We demonstrate that our method captures sudden changes in highly covered news topics as well as multiple differences across search engines and regions over time. We highlight novelty imbalances between candidate queries which affect their visibility during electoral periods, and conclude that, when it comes to news, search engines are responsible for such imbalances, either due to their algorithms or the set of news sources that they rely on.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,,Computer Science,SS,24,"search engines, performance, open science, political science, 2021",1.0

Measuring Growth Mindset: Validation of a Three-Item and a Single-Item Scale in Adolescents and Adults,"{A growth mindset is a belief that personal characteristics, specifically intellectual ability, are malleable and can be developed by investing time and effort. Numerous studies have investigated the associations between a growth mindset and academic achievement, and large intervention programs have been established to train adolescents to develop a stronger growth mindset. However, methodological research on the adequacy of the measures used to assess a growth mindset is scarce. In our study, we conducted one of the first comprehensive assessments of the psychometric properties of Dweck s widely used three-item Growth Mindset Scale in two samples (adolescents aged 14-19 years and adults aged 20-64 years). We test the comparability (i.e., measurement invariance) of the scale across these age groups. Furthermore, using the same two samples, we identified and validated a single-item measure to assess growth mindset in settings with severe time constraints. Results reveal that both the three-item and the single-item scales have acceptable psychometric properties regarding reliability, comparability, and validity.

Improving media trust research through better measurement: An item response theory perspective,"{While trust in news media has come to the forefront of scholarly and public debate in recent years, academic researchers have raised persistent concern that measurement issues have prevented a better understanding of the concept. This research introduces an item response theory (IRT) perspective to advance the state-of-the-art in media trust measurement beyond recent conceptual and analytical progress. I argue that standard survey instruments that concentrate on the perceived believability of news media restrict our capability to measure truly low media trust. Furthermore, I suggest an important yet previously unnoticed pathway to overcoming this restriction in a scale by Abdulla et al. that captures currency perceptions alongside believability perceptions. Using a representative survey conducted in Germany, I find robust empirical evidence that capturing currency vs. believability perceptions significantly impacts our ability to accurately measure lower vs. higher levels of media trust. The findings have implications for not only studies of media trust’s associations with antecedent and consequential constructs but any attempt to determine the true amount and divergence of citizens’ media trust. More generally, the results demonstrate how IRT aids in putting scholarly debates on the dimensionality and interplay of trust with distrust on more common and fruitful grounds.}",2024,Journal of Trust Research,"{confirmatory item factor analysis,item response theory,measurement,media trust,news credibility,news media,survey research}",Psychology,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",1.0
"Unravelling the relationship between employment, social transfers and income poverty: Policy and measurement","{Despite the rise in employment, consistently high EU-average poverty rates continue to generate debates about the factors that explain the level and changes in the relative poverty rate, both within and across countries. Assuming a strong negative correlation between poverty and employment, the article investigates the role of four mechanisms responsible for this blurred relationship. Using decomposition analysis and macro-level regression analysis, we investigate the extent to which (i) the distribution of employment across households with different levels of work intensity, (ii) the expansion of non-standard work, (iii) the change in the effectiveness of social welfare systems, and (iv) the change in median income and the corresponding shift in the poverty threshold have contributed to changes in relative income poverty in the last decades. We found that employment growth benefits poverty reduction, but this positive effect was partially offset by the precarious characteristics of some newly created jobs. If the distribution of jobs had favoured the jobless more in the pre-crisis period, the relative income poverty rate would have been lower. Although the share of persons in jobless households decreased during the recovery years, their risk of poverty increased due to the retrenchment of social transfers during and after the Great Recession. Furthermore, the use of a floating threshold, which is linked to changes in median income, underestimates the strength of the relationships between poverty, employment and social transfers: when the poverty threshold is kept fixed, not only do the dynamics of poverty look different, but the estimated coefficients are considerably larger.}",2024,Journal of European Social Policy,"{employment,european union,fixed-effects panel regression,median income,relative income poverty,social transfers}",,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Harmony or Cacophony? A Disaggregated Analysis of Aid Fragmentation,"{Aid effectiveness is widely understood to suffer when multiple donors operate in the same space, but recent studies indicate benefits of fragmentation. We posit that these mixed findings may reflect differences across aid sectors — and also show how the level of implementation can condition the interpretation of results. Cross-national time-series analysis of 152 countries implies aid fragmentation can promote child survival and improve governance. However, analysis of subnational variation in Sierra Leone and Nigeria suggests the presence of more donors is associated with worse health outcomes, but better governance outcomes. Having more donors in a locality may thus be beneficial when they are working to improve the systems through which policies are implemented, but harmful if they target policy outcomes directly. A survey of Nigerian civil servants suggests potential mechanisms: fragmentation in health aid may lead to internal “brain drain” and pressure to alter projects, whereas diversity in governance aid might promote meritocratic behavior.}",2024,Studies in Comparative International Development,"{africa,aid effectiveness,development assistance,foreign aid,governance}",Social Sciences,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",0.2502912866856493
SEQUENTIAL AND CONCURRENT MIXED-MODE DESIGNS: A TAILORED APPROACH,"{Due to rising costs and declining response rates, surveys are increasingly moving from face-to-face interviewing to a self-administered mixed-mode design. Mixed-mode surveys can be conducted using a concurrent or a sequential design. A sequential design in which the web mode is offered first is a common strategy for mixed-mode surveys as it reduces survey costs. However, when deciding which mode choice sequence to use, sample balance should also be considered. One approach to achieving a balanced sample might be to tailor the sequence of the choice of modes, or the mode choice sequence. For this purpose, we use an indicator that assigns the sampled persons to the different mode choice sequences to minimize the variability of response probabilities. In this study, we compare the sample composition achieved with a concurrent and a sequential design. Additionally, we investigate whether indicator-based tailoring of the two mode choice sequences can improve sample composition. We implemented a randomized experiment in the 2021 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), which surveyed the general population aged 18 and older in private households (N 5,342) using a mixed-mode design (web and mail). In a first step, respondents were randomly assigned to a concurrent or a sequential design. We find that the two mode choice sequences lead to a similar sample composition. Next, we identify age as the best available single indicator of the variables known before the survey to tailor the mode choice sequence. Our analyses show that a tailored approach based on age improves the sample composition slightly.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,,Social Sciences,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",1.0
State investigative interest varies across daily life and predicts academic engagement: Replication and extension of the nomological network,"{Recent contributions propose to integrate a state perspective into the conceptualization of vocational interests. Such integration addresses in-the-moment expressions of interests and allows to track relations to distal outcomes of vocational interests more closely. To further the trait-state integration of vocational interests, insights into the nomological network of state vocational interests are necessary. In this preregistered experience sampling study of 217 university students, we studied state investigative interest in daily life and the relations with theory-derived person- and situation-related constructs. Results from 5631 observations across 3.5 weeks showed that specific situation characteristics, openness, happiness, and current social student role were associated with state investigative interest. Furthermore, person-aggregated state investigative interest and the reactivity of investigative interest in situations related with their academic studies predicted individuals’ overall academic engagement in some cases. Generally, the relations in the nomological network were stronger when state investigative interest and hypothesized constructs were more closely aligned. Overall, the results underline the systematic nature and psychological relevance of state vocational interests. We discuss how integrating a state perspective into research on vocational interests implies novel approaches for capitalizing on the power of vocational interests.}",2024,European Journal of Personality,"{experience sampling,investigative interest,situation characteristics,state interest,vocational interests}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.3894482158250276
Fixed is not the opposite of growth: Item keying matters for measuring mindsets,"{Research on growth mindset, the belief that one’s cognitive abilities are malleable and can be developed through dedication and practice, has received considerable media attention and influenced educational policy and practice. However, mindset theory and measurement have also drawn criticism. In the present paper, we add a cautionary note pertaining to the conceptualization and measurement of growth mindset. Through a critical reanalysis of a large-scale representative study of adolescents from the US (N = 15,362), we show that a growth (i.e., forward-keyed) and a fixed (i.e., reverse keyed) mindset item from a widely used scale are only moderately correlated (r = −.31). Further, we demonstrate that the two items are very differently related with a range of educationally relevant criteria such as learning engagement and self-efficacy, and sociodemographic characteristics such as sex. This leads us to conclude that the growth and fixed mindset items are not mutually interchangeable (apart from keying) indicators of a unidimensional construct that has fixed and growth mindset at its opposing poles. Which items researchers choose to measure mindset (fixed, growth, or a blend thereof) may therefore have a significant impact on the findings they obtain. Our insights highlight the need for greater attention to the conceptual foundations and measurement of mindset in future studies.}",2024,Social Psychology of Education,"{acquiescence,dimensionality,fixed mindset,growth mindset,item keying,validity}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.19264109207077473

"Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic","{Introduction: This research examines the effect of individual differences in the need for cognitive closure and political trust on the endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We hypothesize that individuals high in cognitive closure and low in political trust will seize on conspiracy accounts of the pandemic. In contrast, we expect that individuals high in cognitive closure and political trust are more likely to disregard conspiracies surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: To test our preregistered hypotheses, we rely on data from multiple waves of a representative survey among the German population (N = 2,883). The need for cognitive closure and general political trust was assessed before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, while belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and specific trust in handling the crisis was fielded during the second wave of the pandemic. Results: We find that individuals with a high need for cognitive closure are more likely to accept conspiracy narratives, but the effect size is small. At the same time, pre-pandemic trust and concurrent trust in political and medical institutions are strongly negatively related to conspiracy beliefs. We find no support for a moderating effect of political trust. Conclusion: This study finds only small effects for individual differences in the need for cognitive closure but strong effects for political trust in explaining conspiracy beliefs. It underlines the importance of a lack of trust in political institutions for democratic societies in the age of misinformation and post-truth politics.}",2024,Frontiers in Social Psychology,"{cognitive style,conspiracy beliefs,coronavirus,covid-19,need for cognitive closure,political trust}",Social Sciences,SS,10,"covid 19 pandemic, trust, actor, social science, hybrid",0.24346799916777806
How shared ties and journalistic cultures shape global news coverage of disruptive media events: the case of the 9/11 terror attacks,"{In recent decades, disruptive media events, such as major terrorist attacks, have gained increasing relevance in news coverage around the world. Despite the growing importance of such globally broadcast media events, little research to date has examined cross-national variation in event coverage or the predictors of this variation. This study examines news coverage about the 9/11 terror attacks in the United States across 51 countries to analyze whether the topical focus and emotional tone of news coverage about the attacks varied according to a country's proximity to the United States and the dominant role perceptions of its journalistic culture. We show that these macro-level predictors are associated in varying degrees with the country-level topical focus and emotional tone of reporting over the 30 days following this salient event.

What Did I Say Again? Relating User Needs to Search Outcomes in Conversational Commerce,"{Recent advances in natural language processing and deep learning have accelerated the development of digital assistants. In conversational commerce, these assistants help customers find suitable products in online shops through natural language conversations. During the dialogue, the assistant identifies the customer's needs and preferences and subsequently suggests potentially relevant products. Traditional online shops often allow users to filter search results based on their preferences using facets. Selected facets can also serve as a reminder of how the product base was filtered. In conversational commerce, however, the absence of facets and the use of advanced natural language processing techniques can leave customers uncertain about how their input was processed by the system. This can hinder transparency and trust, which are critical factors influencing customers' purchase intentions. To address this issue, we propose a novel text-based digital assistant that, in the product assessment step, explains how specific product aspects relate to the user's previous utterances to enhance transparency and facilitate informed decision-making. We conducted a user study (N=135) and found a significant increase in user-perceived transparency when natural language explanations and highlighted text passages were provided, demonstrating their potential to extend system transparency to the product assessment step in conversational commerce.}",2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"{chatbot,conversational commerce,conversational search,conversational user interfaces,explanations,product search}",Computer Science,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.0006092875594516068
Aspects of Utilization of Psychotherapy in Germany in Times of the GDR and Later,"{Objective The aim of the study was to examine real differences in the use of psychotherapy in the New Federal States during the GDR era and today. In addition, differences according to the willingness seeking psychotherapy as well as barriers in opinions and contact to the mentally ill between people from the New Federal States, the Old Federal States and people who moved from the New Federal States to the Old Federal States (internal migrants) should be recorded, taking into account generational effects (experience of the Cold War - birth before / after January 1 st, 1980). Methods To investigate these questions, the data from a representative survey in the New Federal States of N=2729 people as well as the data from a second online based survey of people from the New and Old Federal States as well as internal migrants with a total of N=4789 participants were evaluated. Results There was a prevalence of 1% for the use of psychotherapy during the GDR era. Overall, the prevalence of therapy experiences among people who experienced the GDR and were born before January 1 st in 1980 was almost 13%. They also reported greater willingness seeking help for mental suffering since the end of the Cold War. The prevalence among younger people was about 12%. In the second survey, there were significant differences, among the older respondents. East Germans today and even during the GDR era were less willing to seek psychotherapy for mental suffering, they also have less contact to mentally ill people. Differences according to desires for distance from mentally ill people, self stigmatization in the presence of a mental illness and discrimination against mentally ill people emerged between East Germans, West Germans and internal migrants depending on generational affiliation. Discussion Barriers that prevent the use of psychotherapy should be taken into account on a generational and socialization specific basis. Socialization as a relevant factor might explain a lack of willingness to utilize psychotherapy amongst people that experienced the GDR era and still live in the new Federal States.}",2024,PPmP Psychotherapie Psychosomatik Medizinische Psychologie,"{gdr,helpseeking,psychotherapy}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Tit for tat? EU risk-sharing and experienced reciprocity,"{As with previous crises, EU-wide risk-sharing has also been demanded during the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, this crisis did not unfold in a political vacuum. Instead, public backing for EU-wide risk-sharing might have been informed by past crises experiences. Building on the idea of experienced reciprocal risk-sharing, we assume that the willingness to share risks is greater when a crisis-ridden country has also shown solidarity before, whereas readiness to cooperate may be mitigated by non-solidarity-oriented behaviour in the past. We test this assumption based on a survey experiment carried out in eleven EU countries in 2020. Our findings suggest that, when people are given information about whether another country has acted in solidarity in the past, this influences their willingness to support risk-sharing in the present. However, we also find evidence that respondents’ preferences outside the experimental setting do not always match their country's recent history of reciprocal risk-sharing.}",2024,Journal of European Public Policy,"{collective memory,covid-19,crises,eu,reciprocity,risk-sharing}",Social Sciences,SS,25,"risk, children, immigration, 19 pandemic, 2020",1.0
Party Competition Over Democracy: Democracy as Electoral Issue in Germany,"{Elected leaders increasingly undermine liberal democratic institutions with the support of their voters, openly challenging liberal democratic institutions in election campaigns. However, political scientists thus far have lacked the theoretical and empirical tools to study the role of elections in democratic backsliding.

By investigating how German citizens and parties of the postwar period spoke about democracy per se and liberal democracy in their regional and national election manifestos, this article shows that democracy per se and liberal democracy, in particular, have been issues of different qualities in German postwar elections. While parties have used references to democracy in general as a mixed issue, showing both signs of valence and positional issues, parties’ emphasis on liberal democracy is shaped by a positional logic. Social and direct democracy have also been positional issues. Studying democracy and its various conceptions as electoral issues will help us address many important questions concerning the stability of democracies, shifting researchers’ focus to the competition of parties over citizens’ support for reforms that undermine or stabilize liberal democracy.}",2024,Politics and Governance,"{direct democracy,germany,liberal democracy,party competition,positional issues,social democracy,valence issues}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.0977469283036907
The interplay of structural features and observed dissimilarities among centrality indices,"{An abundance of centrality indices has been proposed which capture the importance of nodes in a network based on different structural features. While there remains a persistent belief that similarities in outcomes of indices is contingent on their technical definitions, a growing body of research shows that structural features affect observed similarities more than technicalities. We conduct a series of experiments on artificial networks to trace the influence of specific structural features on the similarity of indices which confirm previous results in the literature. Our analysis on 1163 real-world networks, however, shows that little of the observations on synthetic networks convincingly carry over to empirical settings. Our findings suggest that although it seems clear that (dis)similarities among centralities depend on structural properties of the network, using correlation type analyses do not seem to be a promising approach to uncover such connections.}",2024,Social Networks,"{centrality,correlation,network topology,threshold graphs}",Social Sciences,SS,27,"family, network, italy, united states, correlation",1.0
Does temporary employment increase length of commuting? Longitudinal evidence from Australia and Germany,"{On average, temporary jobs are far less stable than permanent jobs. This higher instability could potentially lower workers’ incentives to relocate towards the workplace, thereby resulting in longer commutes. However, surprisingly few studies have investigated the link between temporary employment and commuting length. Building on the notion that individuals strive to optimize their utility when deciding where to work and live, we develop and test a theoretical framework that predicts commuting outcomes for different types of temporary workers – fixed-term, casual and temporary agency workers – and in different institutional contexts. We estimate fixed-effects regression models using 17 waves of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). As expected, the results show that the link between temporary employment and commuting length varies by employment type and institutional context. Agency work is associated with longer commutes than permanent work in both countries, whereas this applies to fixed-term contracts for Germany only. For casual work, the findings suggest no commuting length differential to permanent employment. In terms of policy, our findings suggest lengthy commuting can be a side effect of flexible labour markets, with potentially negative implications for worker well-being, transportation management and the environment.}",2024,Transportation,"{casual work,fixed-term contracts,hilda survey,soep,temporary agency work,work-related spatial mobility}",Engineering,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.4141426042857288

Assessing conceptual comparability of single-item survey instruments with a mixed-methods approach,"{An increasing number of research projects and infrastructure services involve pooling data across different survey programs. Creating a homogenous integrated dataset from heterogeneous source data is the domain of ex-post harmonization. The harmonization process involves various considerations. However, chief among them is whether two survey measurement instruments have captured the same concept. This issue of conceptual comparability is a fundamental precondition for pooling different source variables to form a harmonized target variable. Our paper explores this issue with a mixed-methods approach. On the one hand, we use psychometric latent variable modeling by presenting several single-item wordings for social trust to respondents and then performing factor analytic procedures. On the other hand, we complement and contrast these quantitative findings with qualitative findings gained with an open-ended web probe. The combined approach gave valuable insights into the conceptual comparability of the eleven social-trust-related single-item wordings. For example, we find that negative, distrust-related wordings and positive, trust-related wordings should not be pooled into an integrated variable. However, the paper will also illustrate and discuss why it is easier to disprove conceptual comparability than fully prove it.}",2024,Quality and Quantity,"{comparability,harmonization,integrated data analysis,mixedmethods,survey methodology}",,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",1.0
Is the grass greener on the other side?

Moreover, candidates who consider themselves LGB+ do take on significantly less traditional positions on the socio-cultural dimension compared to the position of their party, indicating that increasing descriptive representation of LGB+ individuals in parliament leads to a strengthening of more progressive voices in parliament and a stronger substantive representation of LGB+ interests.}",2024,European Political Science Review,"{german bundestag,lgb+,parliamentary candidates,policy positions,representation}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.3374307145623328

"You Can Knock on the Doors and Windows of the University, but Nobody Will Care: How Universities Benefit from Network Silence around Gender-Based Violence","{This paper exposes the role of universities in creating silence around gender-based violence in higher education, drawing on narratives from 39 qualitative interviews with victims/survivors and bystanders about reporting incidents and experiences. In this paper, we extend concept of ‘network silence’ around sexual harassment to other forms of gender-based violence. Our research applies three components of the theoretical model of network silence, namely, self-silencing by victims/survivors, silencing, and not hearing by others, and analyses their contextual manifestations through the reporting experiences of victims/survivors and bystanders. This helps to identify the traits of the informal organisational structures and power dynamics, gendered attitudes, actors, and factors which facilitate silencing. The intersectional approach in our analysis of organisational contextual traits contributes to the research on inequality regimes in universities. The findings suggest that universities are making limited efforts to address silence around gender-based violence. We conclude that shared beliefs among the leadership about the reputation and prestige of the university facilitate the endurance of silence in universities. Our findings indicate reasons why universities fail to create spaces that are safe from gender-based violence.}",2024,Social Sciences,"{higher education,inequality regime,institutional practices,intersectionality,network silence,qualitative analysis,reporting,sexual harassment,silencing}",,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",0.5614662156282186
"The closer, the better–How perceived ideological proximity between parties affects the emergence of coalition preferences","{While coalition governments have been studied extensively, there remains a lack of understanding of how coalition preferences emerge and what factors are the most influential. Utilising coalition formation theories, this study posits that voters tend to prefer coalitions with a narrower range of ideological differences between 1.) the parties involved and 2.) between the voter and the party perceived to have the greatest ideological distance from the individual. Previous studies have mainly concentrated on a general left-right ideological dimension or specific issue dimensions, despite the fact that some of the countries analysed are characterized by a two-dimensional political space. Using Germany as a case study that exemplifies this inherent two-dimensionality, this analysis adopts a nuanced approach by employing the calculation of Euclidean distance based on socio-economic and socio-cultural measures. This approach aims to explain the formation of coalition preferences leading up to the federal election in 2021. Our results show how strongly the perceived ideological distance of parties contributes to developing preferences for a specific coalition option, even when controlling for party evaluation and socio-demographics. For this reason, they have important implications for the understanding of the emergence of coalition preferences and party competition.}",2024,Political Research Exchange,"{coalition government,coalition preferences,coalition research,coalition theory,german politics}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.3963538802235133

Furthermore, I discuss how the nested structure of legislative behavior and the data generating process influence our theoretic assumptions about parliamentary behavior.

Social media posts as source for political news coverage inside and outside election campaigns: Examining effects on deliberative news media quality,"{Journalists increasingly cite and/or embed social media posts in news articles. While social media posts have been found to be of little deliberative quality, we do not know whether this also affects the deliberative quality of the news. Against the background of a hybrid media system and deliberative news media standards, we answer this research question with a content analysis of news articles including or not including posts from X (formerly Twitter) in the twelve widest-reaching German news websites prior and after the German general election 2021. We were particularly interested in the differences inside and outside election campaigns as the interdependence of the mass media and the political sphere is particularly pronounced during campaign periods. Results show that posts are more often cited and/or embedded in news articles inside than outside election campaigns. Articles including posts feature a greater number of actors but are not more diverse as mainly actors from the political center are referenced.

Developing a synthetic news corpus to validate generic frame detection methods,"{Frames are a central concept in communication research. Based on our literature review, we propose that frame identification is an act of identifying selected reality and communicative intention. We then highlight the conceptual and methodological issues of frame identification using computational methods. To avoid the correlation between topics and frames, we provide a synthetic dataset for evaluating frames found in multi-topical news content, using the detection of generic frames as a test case. With this dataset, for the first time, we benchmark manual coding and various automatic and semisupervised methods. Based on the preliminary benchmark results, this study provides evidence that generic frame identification using both manual coding and automatic methods might not be accurate.}",2024,Studies in Communication and Media,,Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",0.08827799362011372
Mind the context! The role of theoretical concepts for analyzing legislative text data,"{With the progressing advances in text analysis methods and the increasing accessibility of parliamentary documents, the range of available tools for legislative scholars has increased massively over the past years. While the potential for comparative studies is huge, researchers can easily overlook the pitfalls associated with analyzing these documents. Against this background, I asses which theoretical considerations need to be carefully thought through preceding any (legislative) text analysis: I show that a clear definition and conceptualization of the unit of analysis such as speech or bill can vary substantially depending on the research interest. Furthermore, I discuss how the nested structure of legislative behavior and the data generating process influence our theoretic assumptions about parliamentary behavior. Based on these concepts, I derive some recommendations for the theoretical approach to quantitative textual analyses of parliamentary documents.}",2024,Research and Politics,"{legislative politics,parliamentary speeches,text-as-data}",Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
An Evaluation of the Determinants of Job Search and Career Advice Assistance Satisfaction of Young People in a Cross-Country Perspective,"{In the context of the debate on the transformation of the welfare state and labour markets in the wake of current challenges and multiple crises, which have been put on the agenda by the consequences of the corona pandemic, climate change, digitalization and automation processes, demographic changes, and increased migration, the role of governments, as well as the work and effectiveness of labour market administration and labour market advice, is increasingly discussed controversially. Therefore, this chapter analyzes the determinants of (dis)satisfaction of young people with career counseling and job search assistance from a cross-country comparative perspective in eleven European countries. Using data from the “Cultural Pathways to Economic Self-Sufficiency and Entrepreneurship” (CUPESSE) survey of 18.475 respondents aged 18 to 35, the influence of different educational levels and (un)employment experiences is analyzed, as well as other potential influencing factors such as age, gender and economic self-sufficiency. The results are interpreted from a country comparative perspective building on the youth welfare citizenship typology by Chevalier evaluating national career advice and job search assistance for different educational levels and employment statuses. They systematically show varying degrees of satisfaction among the target group for different types of youth welfare citizenship, but also country differences for different educational levels, experience of unemployment, gender as well as degrees of economic self-sufficiency. Thereby, implications for the further development of the work of labour market administration and labour market advice in post-pandemic labour markets are derived.}",2024,Contributions to Economics,"{career advice,cupesse,job search assistance,labour market policy evaluation,welfare state attitudes,youth (un)employment}","Economics, Econometrics and Finance",SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.22249433569454974
"Putting authoritarianism in context: A multilevel analysis of regional effects on individual expressions of right-wing authoritarianism, conspiracy mentality, and superstition","{Ever since its original conception, authoritarianism is claimed to be the driving force behind various forms of anti-modern attitudes and politics. While current research mainly focuses on three dimensions of right-wing authoritarianism, namely authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, and conventionalism, the original F-scale was more extensive, including conspiracy mentality and superstition among others. Based on recent empirical observations as well as theoretical claims, this chapter suggests revisiting these concepts. Using a German representative sample (N = 2,522), notable differences between East and West Germany for all five subdimensions were observed in 2022. Multilevel analyses were used to identify and disentangle individual factors as well as sociostructural context factors, which may be responsible for these differences and codetermine the prevalence of the dimensions of authoritarian attitudes. Our analyses reveal that significant regional differences, which go beyond mere East-West differences in authoritarian attitudes in Germany, can partly be explained by the selected context variables. Moreover, collective experiences of deprivation interact with average household income on the district level, and this interaction helps predict authoritarian aggression and submission as well as conspiracy mentality. Nevertheless, individual variables explain more variance overall than contextual variables, particularly in the case of conspiracy mentality and superstition.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.42706787582059624
Political Ideology and Attitudinal Ambivalence: Investigating the Role of Ideological Extremity,"{Are individual differences in political ideology associated with inclinations to hold more or less ambivalent attitudes? Extant research on the linear association of political ideology with attitudinal ambivalence yielded inconsistent findings. The present research tested the hypotheses (a) that the association of political ideology with attitudinal ambivalence is curvilinear with lower levels of ambivalence at both extremes of the ideological spectrum and (b) that higher political interest is associated with lower levels of attitudinal ambivalence. It used data from large and demographically diverse electoral surveys in a set of three studies (Study 1: N = 13,808; Study 2: N = 6,528; Study 3: N = 4,789) that focused on attitudes toward political candidates (Studies 1 and 2) as well as political parties (Study 3) in Germany.

Multiple imputation of partially observed covariates in discrete-time survival analysis,"{Discrete-time survival analysis (DTSA) models are a popular way of modeling events in the social sciences. However, the analysis of discrete-time survival data is challenged by missing data in one or more covariates. Negative consequences of missing covariate data include efficiency losses and possible bias. A popular approach to circumventing these consequences is multiple imputation (MI). In MI, it is crucial to include outcome information in the imputation models. As there is little guidance on how to incorporate the observed outcome information into the imputation model of missing covariates in DTSA, we explore different existing approaches using fully conditional specification (FCS) MI and substantive-model compatible (SMC)-FCS MI. We extend SMC-FCS for DTSA and provide an implementation in the smcfcs R package. We compare the approaches using Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate a good performance of the new approach compared to existing approaches.}",2024,Sociological Methods and Research,"{event analysis,family research,fully conditional specification,missing data,multiple imputation,smcfcs,survival analysis}",Social Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.05806843149395005
Fixed is not the opposite of growth: Item keying matters for measuring mindsets,"{Research on growth mindset, the belief that one’s cognitive abilities are malleable and can be developed through dedication and practice, has received considerable media attention and influenced educational policy and practice. However, mindset theory and measurement have also drawn criticism. In the present paper, we add a cautionary note pertaining to the conceptualization and measurement of growth mindset. Through a critical reanalysis of a large-scale representative study of adolescents from the US (N = 15,362), we show that a growth (i.e., forward-keyed) and a fixed (i.e., reverse keyed) mindset item from a widely used scale are only moderately correlated (r = −.31). Further, we demonstrate that the two items are very differently related with a range of educationally relevant criteria such as learning engagement and self-efficacy, and sociodemographic characteristics such as sex. This leads us to conclude that the growth and fixed mindset items are not mutually interchangeable (apart from keying) indicators of a unidimensional construct that has fixed and growth mindset at its opposing poles. Which items researchers choose to measure mindset (fixed, growth, or a blend thereof) may therefore have a significant impact on the findings they obtain. Our insights highlight the need for greater attention to the conceptual foundations and measurement of mindset in future studies.}",2024,Social Psychology of Education,"{acquiescence,dimensionality,fixed mindset,growth mindset,item keying,validity}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.19051363500747734

To this end, we first provide a systematic overview of the types and purposes of the interviewer-observed paradata most commonly collected in face-to-face interviews—contact form data, interviewer observations, and interviewer evaluations—using the methodology of evidence mapping. Based on selected studies, we illustrate the main purposes of interviewer-observed paradata we identified—including fieldwork management, propensity modeling, nonresponse bias analysis, substantive analysis, and survey data quality assessment. Based on this, we discuss the possible use of interviewer-observed paradata in mixed-mode and innovative data collection methods. We conclude with thoughts on new types of interviewer-observed paradata and the potential of combining paradata from different survey modes.}",2024,International Journal of Market Research,"{capi-plus,contact history information,evidence map,face-to-face interview,interviewer evaluations,interviewer observations,knock-to-nudge,video interview}","Business, Management and Accounting",SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",1.0
Is there a geography of Euroscepticism among the winners and losers of globalization?,"{Support for EU membership has long been an important topic of study. Individual-level research shows that winners of globalisation, including the higher educated, express greater EU support as they profit from economic and cultural conditions resulting from European integration. Recent context-focused work suggests that individuals in ‘left-behind’ places are less supportive of EU integration because of their home regions’ weaker long-term economic conditions. This paper brings these two research strands into conversation with each other by examining how the relationship between EU support and individual-level education is contingent on subnational economic conditions. Using harmonised Eurobarometer data from almost 750,000 respondents spanning 2004–2019, combined with subnational economic data from 201 European regions, we find no evidence that subnational economic conditions influence the relationship between EU support and respondents’ education level. At the same time, when cross-sectionally comparing long-term differences between regions, we find that EU support is positively related to regional GDP per capita (though unrelated to regional unemployment), among both the higher and lower educated, and especially in the post-Great Recession period. Longitudinally, EU support is positively related to declining regional unemployment, both among the higher and lower educated, but not to increasing regional GDP per capita.}",2024,Journal of European Public Policy,"{education,euroscepticism,political geography,subnational economic conditions}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.05082773441634228
Analyzing Security and Privacy Advice During the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine on Twiter,"{The Russian Invasion of Ukraine in 2022 resulted in a rapidly changing cyber threat environment globally and incentivized the sharing of security and privacy advice on social media. Previous research found a strong impact of online security advice on end-user behavior. Twitter is an important platform for sharing information in crises. We examined 306 tweets with security and privacy advice related to the Ukrainian war, and created a taxonomy of 224 unique pieces of advice in seven categories, targeted at individuals or organizations in Ukraine and elsewhere. While our findings include untargeted and generic advice known from previous research, we identify novel advice specific to the invasion, offers for individual consultation, and misinformation on security and privacy advice as a new threat. Our findings highlight the strengths and shortcomings of the security and privacy advice given online during the invasion and establish areas for improvements and future research.}",2024,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,"{security and privacy advice,twitter,ukraine}",Computer Science,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.4469375695193907
"Consent to data linkage for different data domains–the role of question order, question wording, and incentives","{As our modern world has become increasingly digitalized, various types of data from different data domains are available that can enrich survey data. To link survey data to other sources, consent from the survey respondents is required. This article compares consent to data linkage requests for seven data domains: administrative data, smartphone usage data, bank data, biomarkers, Facebook data, health insurance data, and sensor data. We experimentally explore three factors of interest to survey designers seeking to maximize consent rates: consent question order, consent question wording, and incentives. The results of the study using a German online sample (n = 3,374) show that survey respondents have a relatively high probability of consent to share smartphone usage data, Facebook data, and biomarkers, while they are least likely to share their bank data in a survey. Of the three experimental factors, only the consent question order affected consent rates significantly. Additionally, the study investigated the interactions between the three experimental manipulations and the seven data domains, of which only the interaction between the data domains and the consent question order consistently showed a significant effect.}",2024,International Journal of Social Research Methodology,"{consent,data domain,data linkage,experiment,online surveys,question position}",,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.43298716074712934

Supporting Data Discovery: Comparing Perspectives of Support Specialists and Researchers,"{Purpose: Much of the research in data discovery is centered on the users’ viewpoint, frequently overlooking the perspective of those who develop and maintain the discovery infrastructure. Our goal is to conduct a comparative study on research data discovery, examining both support specialists’ and researchers’ views by merging new analysis with prior research insights. Methods: This work summarizes the studies the authors have conducted over the last seven years investigating the data discovery practices of support specialists from different disciplines. Although support specialists were not the main target of some of these studies, data about their perspectives was collected. Our corpus comprises in-depth interviews with 6 social science support specialists, interviews with 19 researchers and 3 support specialists from multiple disciplines, a global survey with 1630 researchers and 47 support specialists, and a use case analysis of 25 support specialists. In the analysis section, we juxtapose the fresh insights on support specialists’ views with the already documented perspectives of researchers for a holistic understanding. The latter is primarily discussed in the literature review, with references made in the analysis section to draw comparisons. Results: We found that support specialists’ views on data discovery are not entirely different from those of the researchers. There are, however, some differences that we have identified, most notably the interconnection of data discovery with general web search, literature search, and social networks. Conclusion: We conclude by proposing recommendations for different types of support work to better support researchers’ data discovery practices.}",2024,Data Science Journal,"{data discovery,data reuse,research data management,research data services}",Computer Science,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.943206077112561
Antisemitism in East and W est Germany: Three decades after the wall: a comparative longitudinal study considering age-period-cohort effects,"{Since the unification of the two German states in 1990, antisemitic attitudes have been repeatedly polled in cross-sectional or longitudinal national surveys (e.g., the long-term GFE surveys). So far, comparative studies analyzing the development of antisemitism in East and West Germany over a longer time period are scarce. The study covers a time span of 30 years to investigate two forms of antisemitism (classical and secondary), especially with respect to inner-German differences. Applying model-based age-period-cohort analyses (APC) with a total of 19 available representative surveys (maximal period: 1991-2021), theory-driven hypotheses are tested. The statistical approach and respective findings are discussed with emphasis on several challenges accompanying the utilized heterogenous data and different survey modes. Findings reveal that life-cycle effects play a decisive role in the attitudinal development and distribution of antisemitic attitudes. Moreover, approval of antisemitism is to some extent cohort related in both East and West Germany, while disentangling period effects empirically poses challenges due to data limitations. Furthermore, the observed APC structures differ for classical and secondary antisemitism. The chapter concludes with a critical discussion of the results, limitations, and some further thoughts on the open science philosophy in applied social science research.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,19,"chapter, processes, germany, changes, political attitudes",1.0
Measuring Global Character Dimensions: An Ant Colony Optimization Approach toward Three Core Strength Scales,"{The Values in Action (VIA) framework encompasses 24 universally valued character strengths. Recent factor-analytic work has identified three global core strengths (metatraits) that proved to be well-interpretable and cross-culturally replicable: positivity, dependability, and mastery. However, there are no short scales to economically measure these core strengths that would encourage (large-scale) survey-based research on the global level of the VIA trait space. In the present study, we selected 18 items to measure the three metatraits from the 96-item IPIP-VIA-R inventory. To optimize the item selection while considering multiple psychometric criteria simultaneously, we made use of Ant Colony Optimization. Thereby, we obtained balanced-keyed scales that cover the heterogeneous constructs well, showed good model fit and reliability across six samples from Germany and the U.K. (total N = 2,754), and achieved scalar measurement invariance across countries. Furthermore, we demonstrated each scale’s validity by locating the three core strengths in a nomological net with personality and value metatraits, life satisfaction, and behavioral criteria. Available in the public domain in English and German, these both valid and economical core strength scales may further stimulate integrative research on personality and values.}",2024,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.7371551279085246
GRETA analytics: Communicating the spatial dimension of energy citizenship using a collaborative Shiny app,"{Research output from inter- and trans-disciplinary research projects is challenging to store, link, analyze, and communicate among stakeholders and researchers from other fields.

With a strong geospatial focus and a narrative design, the tool promotes collaborative sense-making processes of the real world instead of plain visualization. This paper addresses the development process, design choices, data integration strategies, architecture details, and deployment methods of the tool.

INNOVATING WEB PROBING: COMPARING WRITTEN AND ORAL ANSWERS TO OPEN-ENDED PROBING QUESTIONS IN A SMARTPHONE SURVEY,"{Cognitive interviewing in the form of probing is key for developing methodologically sound survey questions. For a long time, probing was tied to the laboratory setting, making it difficult to achieve large sample sizes and creating a time-intensive undertaking for both researchers and participants. Web surveys paved the way for administering probing questions over the Internet in a time- and cost-efficient manner. In so-called web probing studies, respondents first answer a question and then they receive one or more open-ended questions about their response process, with requests for written answers. However, participants frequently provide very short or no answers at all to open-ended questions, in part because answering questions in writing is tedious. This is especially the case when the web survey is completed via a smartphone with a virtual on-screen keypad that shrinks the viewing space. In this study, we examine whether the problem of short and uninterpretable answers in web probing studies can be mitigated by asking respondents to complete the web survey on a smartphone and to record their answers via the built-in microphone. We conducted an experiment in a smartphone survey (N= 1,001), randomizing respondents to different communication modes (written or oral) for answering two comprehension probes about two questions on national identity and citizenship. The results indicate that probes with requests for oral answers produce four to five times more nonresponse than their written counterparts. However, oral answers contain about three times as many words, include about 0.3 more themes (first probing question only), and the proportion of clearly interpretable answers is about 6 percentage points higher (for the first probing question only).

AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images,"{Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052 % were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior.

SEQUENTIAL AND CONCURRENT MIXED-MODE DESIGNS: A TAILORED APPROACH,"{Due to rising costs and declining response rates, surveys are increasingly moving from face-to-face interviewing to a self-administered mixed-mode design. Mixed-mode surveys can be conducted using a concurrent or a sequential design. A sequential design in which the web mode is offered first is a common strategy for mixed-mode surveys as it reduces survey costs. However, when deciding which mode choice sequence to use, sample balance should also be considered. One approach to achieving a balanced sample might be to tailor the sequence of the choice of modes, or the mode choice sequence. For this purpose, we use an indicator that assigns the sampled persons to the different mode choice sequences to minimize the variability of response probabilities. In this study, we compare the sample composition achieved with a concurrent and a sequential design. Additionally, we investigate whether indicator-based tailoring of the two mode choice sequences can improve sample composition. We implemented a randomized experiment in the 2021 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), which surveyed the general population aged 18 and older in private households (N 5,342) using a mixed-mode design (web and mail). In a first step, respondents were randomly assigned to a concurrent or a sequential design. We find that the two mode choice sequences lead to a similar sample composition. Next, we identify age as the best available single indicator of the variables known before the survey to tailor the mode choice sequence. Our analyses show that a tailored approach based on age improves the sample composition slightly.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,,Decision Sciences,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",1.0
Why we need to abandon fixed cutoffs for goodness-of-fit indices: An extensive simulation and possible solutions,"{To evaluate model fit in confirmatory factor analysis, researchers compare goodness-of-fit indices (GOFs) against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI >.950) derived from simulation studies. Methodologists have cautioned that cutoffs for GOFs are only valid for settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which cutoffs originated. Despite these warnings, fixed cutoffs for popular GOFs (i.e., χ2, χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) continue to be widely used in applied research. We (1) argue that the practice of using fixed cutoffs needs to be abandoned and (2) review time-honored and emerging alternatives to fixed cutoffs. We first present the most in-depth simulation study to date on the sensitivity of GOFs to model misspecification (i.e., misspecified factor dimensionality and unmodeled cross-loadings) and their susceptibility to further data and analysis characteristics (i.e., estimator, number of indicators, number and distribution of response options, loading magnitude, sample size, and factor correlation). We included all characteristics identified as influential in previous studies. Our simulation enabled us to replicate well-known influences on GOFs and establish hitherto unknown or underappreciated ones. In particular, the magnitude of the factor correlation turned out to moderate the effects of several characteristics on GOFs. Second, to address these problems, we discuss several strategies for assessing model fit that take the dependency of GOFs on the modeling context into account. We highlight tailored (or “dynamic”) cutoffs as a way forward. We provide convenient tables with scenario-specific cutoffs as well as regression formulae to predict cutoffs tailored to the empirical setting of interest.}",2024,Behavior Research Methods,"{confirmatory factor analysis,fit index,goodness-of-fit,ordered categorical data,structural equation modeling}",Psychology,SS,21,"modeling, detection, correlation, gender, depth",1.0
The (fe-)male breadwinner? Beliefs about gender roles in East Germany: An age-period-cohort analysis,"{Background: Beliefs about gender roles develop in a complex interplay of individual factors with the sociopolitical and historical context. They differ between birth cohorts, depend on individual age, and change over time. In recent years, a certain retraditionalization was observed, especially in younger East German birth cohorts. This study investigates whether younger cohorts indeed show more traditional beliefs when considering age and period effects as well as sociodemographic factors. Methods: Using data from seven cross sections (1992 to 2016) of an East German sample of the German General Social Survey (N = 5,426), hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) analyses were applied to simultaneously estimate the effects of age, birth cohort, and time period on gender role beliefs. Results: Significant cohort effects were observed, with those cohorts born and raised in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) showing the most egalitarian views. Similar to the oldest cohorts, the youngest cohorts exhibited more traditional beliefs. Conclusion: The results indeed suggest a trend toward retraditionalization of the gender role beliefs in the generations born after the end of the GDR compared to those born during its existence. Implications as well as limitations of the HAPC method are critically discussed.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Early Childhood Care in the Former East Germany and Mental Stress in Adulthood,"{Background: It is still debated in Germany whether early childhood care outside the family might cause mental stress in adulthood. In the German Democratic Republic (GDR—the former East Germany before unification), children were often cared for outside the family from a very early age. Methods: To determine the relation between early childhood care outside the family and mental stress in adulthood, we carried out a survey among 1575 persons who were born and socialized in the GDR. They were classified into four care groups according to the age at which they were first cared for outside the family. Associations with depressiveness, somatization disorders, and anxiety disorders in adulthood were tested with logistic regression analysis. Care group–specific prevalences of experiences of abuse and neglect in childhood were estimated with analysis of variance. Results: Comparisons of persons cared for outside the family before the age of three, or from the age of three onward, with persons cared for within the family in their preschool years did not reveal any difference with respect to depressiveness (odds ratio [OR] = 0.95; 95% confidence interval [0.58; 1.55]; OR = 1.05 [0.63; 1.74]), somatization disorders (OR = 1.11 [0.74; 1.67]; OR = 1.09 [0.71; 1.66]), or anxiety disorders (OR = 0.87 [0.46; 1.64]; OR = 1.12 [0.59; 2.10]). Nor were there any intergroup differences with respect to experiences of abuse and neglect. Certain features of the very small group of children who had long-term care outside the family are discussed in the article. Conclusion: No relation was found between early-childhood care in day-care centers in the GDR and mental stress in adulthood. The data were too sparse for any conclusions about specific aspects of care outside the home (e.g., quality or child-rearing norms).}",2024,Deutsches Arzteblatt International,,,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.6896587962452561
Asking for Traces: A Vignette Study on Acceptability Norms and Personal Willingness to Donate Digital Trace Data,"{Digital trace data are increasingly used in the social sciences. Given the risks associated with data access via application programming interfaces (APIs) as well as ethical discussions around the use of such data, data donations have been proposed as a methodologically reliable and ethically sound way of collecting digital trace data. While data donations have many advantages, study participants may be reluctant to share their data, for example, due to privacy concerns. To assess which factors in a data donation request are relevant for participants’ acceptance and decisions, we conducted a vignette experiment investigating the general acceptability and personal willingness to donate various data types (i.e., data from GPS, web browsing, LinkedIn/Xing, Facebook, and TikTok) for research purposes. The preregistered study was implemented in the probability-based German Internet Panel (GIP) and gathered responses from n = 3821 participants. Results show that people rate the general acceptability of data donation requests higher than their own willingness to donate data. Regarding the different data types, respondents indicated that they would be more willing to donate their LinkedIn/Xing, TikTok, and GPS data compared to web browsing and Facebook data. In contrast, information about whether the donated data would be shared with other researchers and data security did not affect the responses to the respective donation scenarios. Based on these results, we discuss implications for studies employing data donations.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,"{data donation,data linkage,data sharing consent,digital trace data,privacy attitudes,vignette experiment}",Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",1.0
The Effect of Question Positioning on Data Quality in Web Surveys,"{The quality of data in surveys is affected by response burden and questionnaire length. With an increasing number of questions, respondents can become bored, tired, and annoyed and may take shortcuts to reduce the effort needed to complete the survey. In this article, direct evidence is presented on how the position of items within a web questionnaire influences respondents’ focus of attention. In two experiments, part of an eye-tracking study and an online survey, respectively, a variety of indicators show that data quality is lower if the experimental question is positioned at the end rather than at the beginning of a questionnaire.

Supporting Data Discovery: Comparing Perspectives of Support Specialists and Researchers,"{Purpose: Much of the research in data discovery is centered on the users’ viewpoint, frequently overlooking the perspective of those who develop and maintain the discovery infrastructure. Our goal is to conduct a comparative study on research data discovery, examining both support specialists’ and researchers’ views by merging new analysis with prior research insights. Methods: This work summarizes the studies the authors have conducted over the last seven years investigating the data discovery practices of support specialists from different disciplines. Although support specialists were not the main target of some of these studies, data about their perspectives was collected. Our corpus comprises in-depth interviews with 6 social science support specialists, interviews with 19 researchers and 3 support specialists from multiple disciplines, a global survey with 1630 researchers and 47 support specialists, and a use case analysis of 25 support specialists. In the analysis section, we juxtapose the fresh insights on support specialists’ views with the already documented perspectives of researchers for a holistic understanding. The latter is primarily discussed in the literature review, with references made in the analysis section to draw comparisons. Results: We found that support specialists’ views on data discovery are not entirely different from those of the researchers. There are, however, some differences that we have identified, most notably the interconnection of data discovery with general web search, literature search, and social networks. Conclusion: We conclude by proposing recommendations for different types of support work to better support researchers’ data discovery practices.}",2024,Data Science Journal,"{data discovery,data reuse,research data management,research data services}",Computer Science,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",1.0
Politicized and Paranoid? Assessing Attitudinal Predictors of Alternative News Consumption,"{The study of right-wing alternative news sources has moved to the center of scholarly attention recently. Such sources cater to news consumers characterized by extreme political views and mistrust toward mainstream news. However, research into the predictors of alternative news consumption is still scarce. We approach this gap by combining online tracking and survey data from 2,009 German panel participants. We find conspiratorial thinking and pro-Russian stance to be predictors of alternative news consumption, both in absolute and in relative terms. Our analysis thus contributes to a more nuanced understanding of alternative news consumers.}",2024,Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media,,Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",1.0
"Social Media, Misinformation, and Attitudes Towards Democracy in Germany During the Covid-19 Pandemic","{Social media platforms are a double-edged sword, serving as sources of both critical information and harmful misinformation. This duality has sparked debates about their potential role in threatening democracy, boosting radical parties, and amplifying authoritarian and populist attitudes. While much research has focused on how misinformation and social media usage can influence voting for radical and populist parties, research on how diffuse and specific support for democracy are affected by the level of misinformation is more scarce. This study examines how satisfaction with democracy, democratic legitimacy, and adherence to liberal democratic principles are shaped by social media usage and citizens’ susceptibility to misinformation. Employing novel data from an online survey conducted in Germany in June 2021, we show that political information sources and misinformation exposure have a greater impact on perceptions of democratic functioning than on support for democracy as a political ideal. Furthermore, for citizens prone to believing misinformation, media consumption habits have no significant impact highlighting a critical blind spot in addressing democracy’s resilience in the digital age.}",2024,German Politics,,Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.8080897763895003
When to use the k-rule?-Criteria for managing uniqueness and de-anonymization risk in social science survey data,"{Anonymization plays a large role for data sharing in the social sciences, where research subjects are often human. In this paper we are looking at k-anonymization, an anonymization strategy rarely used in the social sciences. This is due to high-dimensional socio-economic information necessary for social science research. Here, the k-rule is often too rigid and leads to information loss. We argue, however, that certain datasets need to be k-anonymized and suggest criteria to determine the need for this rule. We then apply our criteria to example datasets from a social science data archive. In doing so, we provide criteria for data curators to determine which level of anonymization to apply to data at hand and hands-on examples on how to apply them. We aim to improve workflows for data archives and support safe data sharing practices.}",2024,Transactions on Data Privacy,"{anonymization,data confidentiality,k-anonymity,quasi-identifier,social science}",Computer Science,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",0.595008357501903
Gendered wage returns to changes in non-routine job tasks: Evidence from Germany,"{The labor market exhibits persistent occupational segregation by gender, with women and men performing distinct job tasks within their occupations. Prior research suggests that non-routine job tasks generally lead to higher wages, especially in digitally advancing contexts. However, these findings are largely based on cross-sectional data and neglect gender as a relevant dimension of inequality. We analyze three-wave panel data over nine years from the German National Educational Panel Study to explore the relationship between changes in non-routine job tasks and wages by gender. Given the constrained wage-setting opportunities within German firms, we further examine whether the association between task changes and wages differs for employees with and without job changes, both within and across occupational segments. Our fixed-effect regression analyses reveal gender-specific associations between changes in non-routine job tasks and wage increases. Men benefit from performing more complex and autonomous tasks, with additional gains when an inter-segmental job change accompanies the increase in complex job tasks. Conversely, women do not see wage benefits from enhancements in either complex or autonomous job tasks. These findings underscore the gendered patterns of wage increases associated with advancements in non-routine job tasks, with men profiting intra-individually from shifts towards more non-routine job tasks.}",2024,Research in Social Stratification and Mobility,"{gender segregation,job changes,neps,occupational segregation,panel data,technological change}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.4150140368290337
United in disagreement: Analyzing policy networks in EU policy making,"{Shared belief systems are generally assumed to forge policy networks. Empirical evidence whether and to what extend shared policy core beliefs create ally networks and under which circumstances shared policy core beliefs are not necessary to form these networks, however, is limited. Based on a novel inferential network approach in combination with mediation analysis, this study investigates the role of belief systems as a link between interest group type and policy preference congruence, ultimately leading to ally networks in the European Union. In order to measure the intervening effect of policy core beliefs, automated text analysis is used. Our results suggest that shared policy core beliefs are a strong mediator for members of the same interest group. In addition, “strange bedfellow” networks between NGOs and businesses do, in fact, lack belief congruence and emerge on issues with low potential for intergroup conflict. This paper makes a contribution to our understanding of ally network formation and adds to the emerging line of research which combines quantitative text with inferential network analysis.}",2024,Review of Policy Research,"{advocacy coalitions,automated text analysis,eu energy policy,inferential network analysis,interest groups}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.026930069604869076
Facebook as an Avenue to News: A Comparison and Validation of Approaches to Identify Facebook Referrals,"{Given that Facebook is still the most widely used social networking site in the world, its influence on democratic processes is under constant scrutiny. Academics have put a special focus on Facebook’s role in inhibiting or enhancing citizens’ news exposure. Recent studies using digital behavioral data have analyzed the prevalence and effects of “Facebook news referrals.” Using a web tracking tool that captures general browsing behavior as well as public posts seen on Facebook, this paper lays the groundwork for the field by assessing the validity of previously proposed operationalizations. We validate news referrals by investigating whether different measures actually reflect exposure to a news URL a user saw on Facebook. We furthermore assess the effects of news referrals on central outcomes in extant literature, contingent on different operationalizations. The results show that the most precise measure of news referrals are click identifiers attached to news URLs by Facebook. Different operationalizations of referrals have theoretically impactful consequences for the substantive understanding of Facebook’s role in high-choice online environments. The paper demonstrates the need for academics to constantly innovate in order to measure citizens’ online behavior in an ecologically valid manner.}",2024,Political Communication,"{data linking,facebook,news exposure,referrals,web browsing data}",Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.10970975050020998

While the potential for comparative studies is huge, researchers can easily overlook the pitfalls associated with analyzing these documents. Against this background, I asses which theoretical considerations need to be carefully thought through preceding any (legislative) text analysis: I show that a clear definition and conceptualization of the unit of analysis such as speech or bill can vary substantially depending on the research interest. Furthermore, I discuss how the nested structure of legislative behavior and the data generating process influence our theoretic assumptions about parliamentary behavior. Based on these concepts, I derive some recommendations for the theoretical approach to quantitative textual analyses of parliamentary documents.}",2024,Research and Politics,"{legislative politics,parliamentary speeches,text-as-data}",Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
The (fe-)male breadwinner? Beliefs about gender roles in East Germany: An age-period-cohort analysis,"{Background: Beliefs about gender roles develop in a complex interplay of individual factors with the sociopolitical and historical context. They differ between birth cohorts, depend on individual age, and change over time. In recent years, a certain retraditionalization was observed, especially in younger East German birth cohorts. This study investigates whether younger cohorts indeed show more traditional beliefs when considering age and period effects as well as sociodemographic factors. Methods: Using data from seven cross sections (1992 to 2016) of an East German sample of the German General Social Survey (N = 5,426), hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) analyses were applied to simultaneously estimate the effects of age, birth cohort, and time period on gender role beliefs. Results: Significant cohort effects were observed, with those cohorts born and raised in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) showing the most egalitarian views. Similar to the oldest cohorts, the youngest cohorts exhibited more traditional beliefs. Conclusion: The results indeed suggest a trend toward retraditionalization of the gender role beliefs in the generations born after the end of the GDR compared to those born during its existence. Implications as well as limitations of the HAPC method are critically discussed.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Do social engagement skills exist and matter beyond personality facet traits and vocational interests? A generalization study across six countries,"{Social engagement skills as capacities for active interpersonal engagement are thought to conceptually differ from behavioral and motivational tendencies and to predict learning and life outcomes. We tested these assumptions on the distinct nature and relevance of social engagement skills. Quota-representative self-reports from 6987 adults in six countries showed strong relations of social engagement skills with personality facets and weaker with vocational interests. Partially supporting their distinctiveness, social engagement skills were not fully reducible to those correlates. Skills predicted self-reported learning, quality-of-life, and job outcomes, but offered little incremental validity beyond personality and interests. Results largely generalized across countries. Yet, the complex interplay between social engagement skills, individual differences, and outcomes demonstrated cross-country variations, suggesting sensitivity to sociocontextual factors. We conclude that while social engagement skills conceptually differ from personality and interests and in themselves predict life success, they add limited empirical value beyond these constructs, at least for self-reports. Educational relevance statement: Social engagement skills are the capacities to actively engage with others. It is thought that these capacities differ from other person characteristics (e.g., behavioral or motivational tendencies), and that this distinction matters for explaining life success. Our study showed that while self-reported social engagement skills shared similarities with other person characteristics, they still had unique aspects. Moreover, social engagement skills mattered, such that more skilled adults reported higher quality-of-life, but not necessarily better learning. However, social engagement skills did not provide much extra insight into life success beyond what was already known from other person characteristics. Other than the remaining results, these complex relations between social engagement skills, person characteristics, and life success largely varied across countries. The results highlight the importance of assessing social skills in a situation-specific manner, which will be imperative for targeted educational practices in the future. Moreover, our study focused on adults, limiting applicability to youth, but results suggest that intervention efforts targeting social engagement skills may probably yield more interpersonal than academic benefits. Finally, when designing or adapting complex educational programs, practitioners should consider sociocontextual factors.}",2024,Learning and Individual Differences,"{cross-national data,individual differences,learning,life outcomes,social-emotional skills}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
"Socio-emotional experiences of primary school students: Relations to teachers’ underestimation, overestimation, or accurate judgment of their cognitive ability","{Previous research revealed that students who are overestimated in their ability by their teachers experience school more positively than underestimated students. In the present study, we compared the socio-emotional experiences of N = 1516 students whose cognitive abilities were overestimated, accurately judged, or underestimated by their teachers. We applied propensity score matching using students’ cognitive ability, gender, language, parental education, and teacher’s acquaintance with them as covariates for building the three student groups. Matching students on these variables, reduced the original sample size to subsamples with n1 = 348, and n2 = 312 with exact matching including classroom. We compared overestimated, accurately judged, or underestimated students in both matching samples in their socio-emotional profiles (comprised of academic self-concept, joy of learning, attitude towards school, willingness to make an effort, social integration, perceived class climate, and feeling of being accepted by the teacher) by linear discriminant analyses. Groups significantly differed in their profiles. Overestimated students had the most positive socio-emotional experiences of school, followed by accurately judged students. Underestimated students experienced school most negatively. Differences in experiences were most pronounced for the learning environment (medium to large effects for academic self-concept, joy of learning, and willingness to make an effort; negligible effect for attitude towards school) and less for the social environment (medium effects for feeling of being accepted by the teacher; negligible effects for social integration and perceived class climate).}",2024,Social Psychology of Education,"{cognitive ability,primary school,propensity score matching,socio-emotional experiences,teacher judgment accuracy}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.8283705313134622
Novelty in News Search: A Longitudinal Study of the 2020 US Elections,"{The 2020 US elections news coverage was extensive, with new pieces of information generated rapidly. This evolving scenario presented an opportunity to study the performance of search engines in a context in which they had to quickly process information as it was published. We analyze novelty, a measurement of new items that emerge in the top news search results, to compare the coverage and visibility of different topics. Using virtual agents that simulate human web browsing behavior to collect search engine result pages, we conduct a longitudinal study of news results of five search engines collected in short bursts (every 21 minutes) from two regions (Oregon, US and Frankfurt, Germany), starting on election day and lasting until one day after the announcement of Biden as the winner. We find more new items emerging for election related queries (“joe biden,” “donald trump,” and “us elections”) compared to topical (e.g., “coronavirus”) or stable (e.g., “holocaust”) queries. We demonstrate that our method captures sudden changes in highly covered news topics as well as multiple differences across search engines and regions over time. We highlight novelty imbalances between candidate queries which affect their visibility during electoral periods, and conclude that, when it comes to news, search engines are responsible for such imbalances, either due to their algorithms or the set of news sources that they rely on.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,,Social Sciences,SS,24,"search engines, performance, open science, political science, 2021",1.0

Uncovering latent profiles of ICT self-concept among adults in Germany and their relation with gender,"{Self-concept related to the use of information and communication technology (ICT-SC) is reflected in how people feel and behave when confronted with digital technologies. Although evidence from variable-centered analyses suggests a hierarchical and multidimensional structure of ICT-SC in heterogeneous populations, it is not yet known whether different profiles of general ICT-SC and specific ICT-SC domains (communicate, process and store, generate content, safe application, solve problems) exist. This study aims to extend previous research using person-centered analyses and to examine whether different profiles of ICT-SC can be identified in a heterogeneous adult population (18–69 years) from Germany and how these profiles relate to gender. Results of a latent profile analysis (German quota sample, N = 369) indicate a reliable three-profile solution. Profile I (n = 48) is characterised by rather low ICT-SC with relative profile strengths in the verbal-interactive domains (communicate, process and store). Profile II (n = 149) is characterised by low to average ICT-SC across ICT-SC domains. Profile III (n = 172) is characterised by high ICT-SC with profile strengths in the technical-analytical domains (safe application, solve problems). Gender did not correlate significantly with profile membership.

LGB+ identity and its implications for the policy positions of parliamentary candidates,"{Several studies concentrate on the representation of minority groups and the policy goals that members of these groups highlight when becoming candidates for public offices. However, we do not know much about the degree of parliamentary representation of sexual minorities and what ideological profile politicians with an LGB+ identity adopt. We aim at filling this gap by analysing the ideological stances of LGB+ candidates on key policy dimensions. Using data from the 2021 German candidate study, we find that the self-identification as LGB+ contributes significantly to adopting progressive stances on the socio-cultural dimension and more favourable positions on welfare state expansion, regardless of further important factors like party affiliation. Moreover, candidates who consider themselves LGB+ do take on significantly less traditional positions on the socio-cultural dimension compared to the position of their party, indicating that increasing descriptive representation of LGB+ individuals in parliament leads to a strengthening of more progressive voices in parliament and a stronger substantive representation of LGB+ interests.}",2024,European Political Science Review,"{german bundestag,lgb+,parliamentary candidates,policy positions,representation}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.3804496466832277

Multiple imputation of partially observed covariates in discrete-time survival analysis,"{Discrete-time survival analysis (DTSA) models are a popular way of modeling events in the social sciences. However, the analysis of discrete-time survival data is challenged by missing data in one or more covariates. Negative consequences of missing covariate data include efficiency losses and possible bias. A popular approach to circumventing these consequences is multiple imputation (MI). In MI, it is crucial to include outcome information in the imputation models. As there is little guidance on how to incorporate the observed outcome information into the imputation model of missing covariates in DTSA, we explore different existing approaches using fully conditional specification (FCS) MI and substantive-model compatible (SMC)-FCS MI.

Embedding models for supervised automatic extraction and classification of named entities in scientific acknowledgements,"{Acknowledgments in scientific papers may give an insight into aspects of the scientific community, such as reward systems, collaboration patterns, and hidden research trends. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the performance of different embedding models for the task of automatic extraction and classification of acknowledged entities from the acknowledgment text in scientific papers. We trained and implemented a named entity recognition (NER) task using the flair NLP framework. The training was conducted using three default Flair NER models with four differently-sized corpora and different versions of the flair NLP framework. The Flair Embeddings model trained on the medium corpus with the latest FLAIR version showed the best accuracy of 0.79. Expanding the size of a training corpus from very small to medium size massively increased the accuracy of all training algorithms, but further expansion of the training corpus did not bring further improvement. Moreover, the performance of the model slightly deteriorated. Our model is able to recognize six entity types: funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation, and miscellaneous. The model works more precisely for some entity types than for others; thus, individuals and grant numbers showed a very good F1-Score over 0.9. Most of the previous works on acknowledgment analysis were limited by the manual evaluation of data and therefore by the amount of processed data. This model can be applied for the comprehensive analysis of acknowledgment texts and may potentially make a great contribution to the field of automated acknowledgment analysis.}",2024,Scientometrics,"{acknowledgement,flair nlp-framework,named entity recognition,natural language processing,text mining,web of science}",Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",0.1070470533311569
What Did I Say Again? Relating User Needs to Search Outcomes in Conversational Commerce,"{Recent advances in natural language processing and deep learning have accelerated the development of digital assistants. In conversational commerce, these assistants help customers find suitable products in online shops through natural language conversations. During the dialogue, the assistant identifies the customer's needs and preferences and subsequently suggests potentially relevant products. Traditional online shops often allow users to filter search results based on their preferences using facets. Selected facets can also serve as a reminder of how the product base was filtered. In conversational commerce, however, the absence of facets and the use of advanced natural language processing techniques can leave customers uncertain about how their input was processed by the system. This can hinder transparency and trust, which are critical factors influencing customers' purchase intentions. To address this issue, we propose a novel text-based digital assistant that, in the product assessment step, explains how specific product aspects relate to the user's previous utterances to enhance transparency and facilitate informed decision-making. We conducted a user study (N=135) and found a significant increase in user-perceived transparency when natural language explanations and highlighted text passages were provided, demonstrating their potential to extend system transparency to the product assessment step in conversational commerce.}",2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"{chatbot,conversational commerce,conversational search,conversational user interfaces,explanations,product search}",Computer Science,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.0006092882798534425
Improving media trust research through better measurement: An item response theory perspective,"{While trust in news media has come to the forefront of scholarly and public debate in recent years, academic researchers have raised persistent concern that measurement issues have prevented a better understanding of the concept. This research introduces an item response theory (IRT) perspective to advance the state-of-the-art in media trust measurement beyond recent conceptual and analytical progress. I argue that standard survey instruments that concentrate on the perceived believability of news media restrict our capability to measure truly low media trust. Furthermore, I suggest an important yet previously unnoticed pathway to overcoming this restriction in a scale by Abdulla et al. that captures currency perceptions alongside believability perceptions. Using a representative survey conducted in Germany, I find robust empirical evidence that capturing currency vs. believability perceptions significantly impacts our ability to accurately measure lower vs. higher levels of media trust. The findings have implications for not only studies of media trust’s associations with antecedent and consequential constructs but any attempt to determine the true amount and divergence of citizens’ media trust. More generally, the results demonstrate how IRT aids in putting scholarly debates on the dimensionality and interplay of trust with distrust on more common and fruitful grounds.}",2024,Journal of Trust Research,"{confirmatory item factor analysis,item response theory,measurement,media trust,news credibility,news media,survey research}",Social Sciences,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",1.0
Do Online Ads Sway Voters?

In addition, people with less political knowledge and online privacy literacy are more likely to be persuaded by online political ads. However, at the party level, there is no evidence indicating that the effect of political ads on party preference is stronger for new parties than for established parties. Overall, this study shows that voters can be persuaded via the frequency of exposure to online political ads, but the extent to which they are affected can vary.}",2024,Political Communication,"{browser tracking,new party,online political ads,online privacy literacy,panel survey,political knowledge,propensity to vote,vote choice}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.13212778198928943

Against this background, we investigated the effects of panel conditioning by using data from the GESIS Panel, a German mixed-mode probability-based panel study. Using two refreshment samples, we compared three panel cohorts with differing levels of experience on several response quality indicators related to the mechanisms of reflection, satisficing, and social desirability. Overall, we find evidence for both negative (i.e., disadvantageous for response quality) and positive (i.e., advantageous for response quality) panel conditioning. Highly experienced respondents were more likely to satisfice by speeding through the questionnaire. They also had a higher probability of refusing to answer sensitive questions than less experienced panel members. However, more experienced respondents were also more likely to optimize the response process by needing less time compared to panelists with lower experience levels (when controlling for speeding). In contrast, we did not find significant differences with respect to the number of ""don't know""responses, nondifferentiation, the selection of first response categories and mid-responses, and the number of nontriggered filter questions. Of the observed differences, speeding showed the highest magnitude with an average increase of 6.0 percentage points for highly experienced panel members compared to low experienced panelists.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{data quality,longitudinal surveys,panel conditioning,probability-based panel study}",Decision Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.6291887784735493
"Mood and fluency: The case of pronunciation ease, liking and trust","{We explored the impact of mood on the judgemental consequences of word pronounceability in six Experiments (1 preregistered, total N = 1183). Positive and negative mood was induced via video clips (all but Experiment 4) and subliminal affective primes (Experiment 4). Additionally, participants were presented with easy- and difficult-to-pronounce letter strings. These were framed as target words to be judged for liking (Experiments 1–2), as names of eBay sellers to be judged for trustworthiness (Experiments 3–5), or as either seller names or passwords to provoke opposing interpretations of pronunciation fluency (Experiment 6). While pronounceability showed a robust effect across experiments, mood did not modulate the judgemental use of (Experiments 1–4), the correction for (Experiment 5) and the interpretation (Experiment 6) of word pronounceability. In conclusion, the judgemental effects of pronounceability persist despite the presence of more objective and task-pertinent cues, resist judgemental correction and remain unaffected by affective states.}",2024,European Journal of Social Psychology,"{affect,fluency,mood,pronounceability,trust}",Psychology,SS,28,"interviewing, performance, pretesting, machine learning, prevalence",1.0
"Migration, daily commuting, or second residence? The role of location-specific capital and distance to workplace in regional mobility decisions","{BACKGROUND If a new job is located in a different region from the place of residence, individuals or households can choose between moving or commuting. However, so far mobility alternatives and their drivers remain under-researched from a comparative perspective. OBJECTIVE We investigate the determinants of the mobility choices of individuals who have taken a distant job (50 km or more), considering three options, (1) permanent migration, (2) daily commuting, (3) weekly commuting (i.e., a second residence), thereby focusing on the interplay between migration costs linked to different sources of location-specific capital (property ownership, working partner, school-age children) and transition costs linked to the distance travelled. METHODS We use longitudinal data from the German Socio-economic Panel (SOEP, 2001–2019) and estimate probit regression models with Heckman correction to account for sample selection. RESULTS We find that a large distance to the workplace favors the decision to migrate or to commute weekly, while a high endowment with location-specific capital favors daily or weekly commuting. Weekly commuting is particularly chosen when both migration and transition costs are very high. However, parents of school-age children are more inclined to commute daily, suggesting that they are often more willing to accept high transition costs than to be separated from their family during the week. CONTRIBUTION This study is one of the first to differentiate between daily and weekly commuting in a comparative analysis of mobility determinants. It complements previous findings by relying on a precise measure of spatial distance and examining real mobility behavior instead of self-reported mobility intentions.}",2024,Demographic Research,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.41980672835271593

When to use the k-rule?-Criteria for managing uniqueness and de-anonymization risk in social science survey data,"{Anonymization plays a large role for data sharing in the social sciences, where research subjects are often human. In this paper we are looking at k-anonymization, an anonymization strategy rarely used in the social sciences. This is due to high-dimensional socio-economic information necessary for social science research. Here, the k-rule is often too rigid and leads to information loss. We argue, however, that certain datasets need to be k-anonymized and suggest criteria to determine the need for this rule. We then apply our criteria to example datasets from a social science data archive. In doing so, we provide criteria for data curators to determine which level of anonymization to apply to data at hand and hands-on examples on how to apply them.

Party Competition Over Democracy: Democracy as Electoral Issue in Germany,"{Elected leaders increasingly undermine liberal democratic institutions with the support of their voters, openly challenging liberal democratic institutions in election campaigns. However, political scientists thus far have lacked the theoretical and empirical tools to study the role of elections in democratic backsliding. This article theorizes the degree to which democracy in general and liberal democracy more specifically can and should be conceptualized as valence and positional issues in multiparty electoral competitions of established liberal democracies. By investigating how German citizens and parties of the postwar period spoke about democracy per se and liberal democracy in their regional and national election manifestos, this article shows that democracy per se and liberal democracy, in particular, have been issues of different qualities in German postwar elections. While parties have used references to democracy in general as a mixed issue, showing both signs of valence and positional issues, parties’ emphasis on liberal democracy is shaped by a positional logic. Social and direct democracy have also been positional issues. Studying democracy and its various conceptions as electoral issues will help us address many important questions concerning the stability of democracies, shifting researchers’ focus to the competition of parties over citizens’ support for reforms that undermine or stabilize liberal democracy.}",2024,Politics and Governance,"{direct democracy,germany,liberal democracy,party competition,positional issues,social democracy,valence issues}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.09993874665746678

Therefore, a multilevel analysis is applied using the innovative CUPESSE data set, which provides data on young adults and their parents in 65 NUTS-1-regions from 11 European countries. The results show that individual work values of young Europeans are most substantively shaped by the respective values of their parents.

Between urgency and data quality: assessing the FAIRness of data in social science research on the COVID-19 pandemic,"{Balancing speed and quality during crises pose challenges for ensuring the value and utility of data in social science research. The COVID-19 pandemic in particular underscores the need for high-quality data and rapid dissemination. Given the importance of behavioural measures and compliance with measures to contain the pandemic, social science research has played a key role in policymaking during this global crisis. This study addresses two key research questions: How FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) are social science data on the COVID-19 pandemic? Which study features are related to the level of FAIRness scores of datasets? We assess the FAIRness of n = 1131 articles, retrieved through a keyword search in the Web of Science database, employing both automated and manual coding methods. Our study inclusion criteria encompass empirical studies on the COVID-19 pandemic published between 2019 and 2023 with a social science focus and explicit reference to the underlying dataset(s). Our analysis of n = 45 datasets reveals substantial differences in FAIRness for different types of research on the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall FAIRness of data is acceptable, although particularly Reusability scores fall short, in both the manual and the automatic assessment. Further, articles explicitly linked to the Social Science concept in the OpenAlex database exhibit a higher mean overall FAIRness value.

The articles offer a variety of new, rather differentiated insights into how individual-level national identity attitudes and sibling concepts like national pride, patriotism, and nationalist chauvinism are related to societal-level variables that tend to vary with exposure to aspects of globalization, such as migrant influx and economic competition. Aside from the focus on those new contributions, the introduction also offers a few observations on the challenges that the wider national identity research field still faces. Given that the field is dealing with several overlapping attitude concepts, this centrally concerns a partial lack of conceptual clarity, which sometimes translates into ambiguous operationalizations and incomplete or imprecise explication of theoretical mechanisms. We conclude that the contributions of the themed issue, with their careful attention to particular aspects of measures and multi-level processes, may serve as another stepping stone for overcoming at least some of those challenges in the future.}",2024,International Journal of Comparative Sociology,"{comparative surveys,globalization,measurement,national identity,national pride,nationalism,patriotism}",Social Sciences,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",0.6852489199680257

To clarify this point, our study is the first to combine the selection of media inside and outside the West with a distinction between Islamist and right-wing attacks. We compare coverage given to thirty-two right-wing and forty Islamist attacks from 2015 to 2019 in nine Western and eight non-Western English-language media outlets, tapping the differential use of the “terrorist/terrorism” label and textual sentiment. Both (many) Western and (some) non-Western media use this label more frequently in the coverage of Islamist attacks. Importantly, public diplomacy channels from non-Western countries such as China Daily and Sputnik also demonstrate this pattern.

Novelty in News Search: A Longitudinal Study of the 2020 US Elections,"{The 2020 US elections news coverage was extensive, with new pieces of information generated rapidly. This evolving scenario presented an opportunity to study the performance of search engines in a context in which they had to quickly process information as it was published. We analyze novelty, a measurement of new items that emerge in the top news search results, to compare the coverage and visibility of different topics. Using virtual agents that simulate human web browsing behavior to collect search engine result pages, we conduct a longitudinal study of news results of five search engines collected in short bursts (every 21 minutes) from two regions (Oregon, US and Frankfurt, Germany), starting on election day and lasting until one day after the announcement of Biden as the winner. We find more new items emerging for election related queries (“joe biden,” “donald trump,” and “us elections”) compared to topical (e.g., “coronavirus”) or stable (e.g., “holocaust”) queries. We demonstrate that our method captures sudden changes in highly covered news topics as well as multiple differences across search engines and regions over time. We highlight novelty imbalances between candidate queries which affect their visibility during electoral periods, and conclude that, when it comes to news, search engines are responsible for such imbalances, either due to their algorithms or the set of news sources that they rely on.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,,Social Sciences,SS,24,"search engines, performance, open science, political science, 2021",1.0
Fixed is not the opposite of growth: Item keying matters for measuring mindsets,"{Research on growth mindset, the belief that one’s cognitive abilities are malleable and can be developed through dedication and practice, has received considerable media attention and influenced educational policy and practice. However, mindset theory and measurement have also drawn criticism. In the present paper, we add a cautionary note pertaining to the conceptualization and measurement of growth mindset. Through a critical reanalysis of a large-scale representative study of adolescents from the US (N = 15,362), we show that a growth (i.e., forward-keyed) and a fixed (i.e., reverse keyed) mindset item from a widely used scale are only moderately correlated (r = −.31). Further, we demonstrate that the two items are very differently related with a range of educationally relevant criteria such as learning engagement and self-efficacy, and sociodemographic characteristics such as sex. This leads us to conclude that the growth and fixed mindset items are not mutually interchangeable (apart from keying) indicators of a unidimensional construct that has fixed and growth mindset at its opposing poles. Which items researchers choose to measure mindset (fixed, growth, or a blend thereof) may therefore have a significant impact on the findings they obtain. Our insights highlight the need for greater attention to the conceptual foundations and measurement of mindset in future studies.}",2024,Social Psychology of Education,"{acquiescence,dimensionality,fixed mindset,growth mindset,item keying,validity}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.19109465125174777

Is the migrant share really the problem? Size of migrant population and individual authoritarianism as major determinants of xenophobic attitudes,"{Contact hypothesis and threat hypothesis are among the most influential theories of xenophobia. The former proposes that intergroup contact may reduce prejudice. The latter suggests that a large outgroup may increase xenophobic attitudes. Using data of a 2018 German representative sample (N = 2,016), we employed multilevel analyses. As predictors, we looked at outgroup size, gross domestic product, and unemployment rate on a county level. On the individual level, we included authoritarianism and a wide range of sociodemographic variables. Individual authoritarianism was identified as the strongest predictor of xenophobic attitudes. On the county level, a higher proportion of migrants was associated with lower values of xenophobia. This serves as an indicator for contact hypothesis.

The analyses are based on European Union Labour Force Survey data and cover seven European countries. Our results confirm that part-time work is related to the gender gap in leadership positions in all countries studied, with a negative correlation between reduced working hours and holding a supervisory position, and with women being much more likely than men to work part-time. Our findings also suggest that part-time penalties, i.e. the negative association between reduced working hours and having supervisory responsibilities, are gender-specific, but in the sense that they are more pronounced for male workers. Our findings further imply that the extent of part-time penalties is not related to the prevailing part-time culture in a country.}",2024,Soziale Welt,"{european comparison,european labour force survey,gender inequality,job authority,part-time penalty}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.4078372926722249

This study investigates, from an individual perspective, the effect of issue congruency in political ads on immediate responses and voting behaviors. To reach our goal, we combined different types of data collection: mobile experience sampling method (mESM), panel survey, and content analysis. The combined approach allowed us to effectively study targeted ads within the cross-device and cross-platform environment. The results showed that voters perceive online political ads that are about a topic that they care about as more interesting, informative, and persuasive regardless of their partisanship. This positive ad perception subsequently leads to a higher probability of voting for the promoted party in the ad. We also found that an ad discussing a topic in line with the receiver’s concerns positively affects the evaluation of the promoted party in the ad only when the party is already favored by the voter. Taken together, this study provides insights into the conditional effectiveness of data-driven strategies in political campaigns.}",2024,Information Communication and Society,"{data-driven campaigning,issue congruency,mobile experience sampling method,panel survey,vote choice}",Social Sciences,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",1.0
Individual and gender inequality in computer science: A career study of cohorts from 1970 to 2000,"{Inequality prevails in science. Individual inequality means that most perish quickly and only a few are successful, and gender inequality implies that there are differences in achievements for women and men. Using large-scale bibliographic data and following a computational approach, we study the evolution of individual and gender inequality for cohorts from 1970 to 2000 in the whole field of computer science as it grows and becomes a team-based science. We find that individual inequality in productivity (publications) increases over a scholar’s career but is historically invariant, whereas individual inequality in impact (citations), albeit larger, is stable across cohorts and careers. Gender inequality prevails regarding productivity, but there is no evidence for differences in impact. The Matthew Effect is shown to accumulate advantages to early achievements and to become stronger over the decades, indicating the rise of a “publish or perish” imperative. Only some authors manage to reap the benefits that publishing in teams promises. The Matthew Effect then amplifies initial differences and propagates the gender gap.

SEQUENTIAL AND CONCURRENT MIXED-MODE DESIGNS: A TAILORED APPROACH,"{Due to rising costs and declining response rates, surveys are increasingly moving from face-to-face interviewing to a self-administered mixed-mode design. Mixed-mode surveys can be conducted using a concurrent or a sequential design. A sequential design in which the web mode is offered first is a common strategy for mixed-mode surveys as it reduces survey costs. However, when deciding which mode choice sequence to use, sample balance should also be considered. One approach to achieving a balanced sample might be to tailor the sequence of the choice of modes, or the mode choice sequence. For this purpose, we use an indicator that assigns the sampled persons to the different mode choice sequences to minimize the variability of response probabilities. In this study, we compare the sample composition achieved with a concurrent and a sequential design. Additionally, we investigate whether indicator-based tailoring of the two mode choice sequences can improve sample composition. We implemented a randomized experiment in the 2021 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), which surveyed the general population aged 18 and older in private households (N 5,342) using a mixed-mode design (web and mail). In a first step, respondents were randomly assigned to a concurrent or a sequential design. We find that the two mode choice sequences lead to a similar sample composition. Next, we identify age as the best available single indicator of the variables known before the survey to tailor the mode choice sequence. Our analyses show that a tailored approach based on age improves the sample composition slightly.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,,Mathematics,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",1.0
Linguistic_Hygenist at PAN 2024 TextDetox: HybridDetox - A Combination of Supervised and Unsupervised Methods for Effective Multilingual Text Detoxification,"{Text detoxification is the process of revising toxic comments to neutralize their toxicity by eliminating inappropriate content, while preserving the meaning of the message. Toxicity can manifest in various forms, including the use of curse words, insults, hate speech, cyberbullying, or trolling. The present-day social media landscape is rife with toxic comments, necessitating a text detoxification system. Unlike the conventional practice of blocking offensive content through moderation, detoxification preserves the valuable information contained in the message. This paper details our approach for multilingual text detoxification as part of the Multilingual Text Detoxification (TextDetox) 2024 [1] Challenge organized by the PAN lab [2]. Our approach consists of two components i.e., the Supervised T5-BART Module for English and Russian languages with parallel corpora and the Unsupervised PLM Detoxifier for the other seven languages. The Supervised T5-BART Module uses T5 and BART as base models, with exponentially weighted moving average and ROUGE scores as loss functions for Russian and English, respectively. The Unsupervised PLM Detoxifier utilizes hashing techniques, log odds ratio, and linguistic patterns to identify and conceal toxic words across all languages. Additionally, it incorporates a mask prediction model to maintain the original sentence's meaning intact.

Large language models as a substitute for human experts in annotating political text,"{Large-scale text analysis has grown rapidly as a method in political science and beyond. To date, text-as-data methods rely on large volumes of human-annotated training examples, which place a premium on researcher resources. However, advances in large language models (LLMs) may make automated annotation increasingly viable. This paper tests the performance of GPT-4 across a range of scenarios relevant for analysis of political text. We compare GPT-4 coding with human expert coding of tweets and news articles across four variables (whether text is political, its negativity, its sentiment, and its ideology) and across four countries (the United States, Chile, Germany, and Italy). GPT-4 coding is highly accurate, especially for shorter texts such as tweets, correctly classifying texts up to 95% of the time. Performance drops for longer news articles, and very slightly for non-English text. We introduce a ‘hybrid’ coding approach, in which disagreements of multiple GPT-4 runs are adjudicated by a human expert, which boosts accuracy. Finally, we explore downstream effects, finding that transformer models trained on hand-coded or GPT-4-coded data yield almost identical outcomes.

To clarify this point, our study is the first to combine the selection of media inside and outside the West with a distinction between Islamist and right-wing attacks. We compare coverage given to thirty-two right-wing and forty Islamist attacks from 2015 to 2019 in nine Western and eight non-Western English-language media outlets, tapping the differential use of the “terrorist/terrorism” label and textual sentiment. Both (many) Western and (some) non-Western media use this label more frequently in the coverage of Islamist attacks. Importantly, public diplomacy channels from non-Western countries such as China Daily and Sputnik also demonstrate this pattern. Delegitimizing Islamist attacks more than right-wing attacks thus cannot be explained as merely a Western phenomenon alone. We point to alternative explanations and call for greater standardization of coverage across Islamist and right-wing attacks.}",2024,International Journal of Press/Politics,"{automated content analysis,media bias,political violence,social identity theory,terrorism}",Social Sciences,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.35486019062726654
Antisemitism in East and W est Germany: Three decades after the wall: a comparative longitudinal study considering age-period-cohort effects,"{Since the unification of the two German states in 1990, antisemitic attitudes have been repeatedly polled in cross-sectional or longitudinal national surveys (e.g., the long-term GFE surveys). So far, comparative studies analyzing the development of antisemitism in East and West Germany over a longer time period are scarce. The study covers a time span of 30 years to investigate two forms of antisemitism (classical and secondary), especially with respect to inner-German differences. Applying model-based age-period-cohort analyses (APC) with a total of 19 available representative surveys (maximal period: 1991-2021), theory-driven hypotheses are tested. The statistical approach and respective findings are discussed with emphasis on several challenges accompanying the utilized heterogenous data and different survey modes. Findings reveal that life-cycle effects play a decisive role in the attitudinal development and distribution of antisemitic attitudes. Moreover, approval of antisemitism is to some extent cohort related in both East and West Germany, while disentangling period effects empirically poses challenges due to data limitations. Furthermore, the observed APC structures differ for classical and secondary antisemitism. The chapter concludes with a critical discussion of the results, limitations, and some further thoughts on the open science philosophy in applied social science research.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,19,"chapter, processes, germany, changes, political attitudes",1.0
Beyond Facts: 4th International Workshop on Computational Methods for Online Discourse Analysis,"{Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts (events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. Computational methods, mostly from the field of NLP, have emerged that tackle a wide range of tasks in this context, including argument and opinion mining, claim detection, checkworthiness detection, stance detection or fact verification. However, computational models require robust definitions of classes and concepts under investigation. Thus, these computational tasks require a strong interdisciplinary and epistemological foundation, specifically with respect to the underlying definitions of key concepts such as claims, arguments, stances, check-worthiness or veracity. This requires a highly interdisciplinary approach combining expertise from fields such as communication studies, computational linguistics and computer science. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across communities. From a computational perspective, in order to address this complexity, the synergy of multiple approaches, coming both from symbolic (knowledge representation) and statistical AI seem to be promising to tackle such challenges. This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the analysis of societal debates on the Web. Beyond research into information and knowledge extraction, data consolidation and modeling for knowledge graphs building, the workshop targets communities focusing on the analysis of online discourse, relying on methods from machine learning, natural language processing, large language models and Web data mining.}",2024,WWW 2024 Companion - Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference,"{computational fact-checking,computational journalism,intent detection,knowledge graphs,language models,mis- and disinformation spread and detection,online discourse analysis,social web mining,stance / viewpoint discovery}",Computer Science,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
Revisiting The Classics: A Study on Identifying and Rectifying Gender Stereotypes in Rhymes and Poems,"{Rhymes and poems are a powerful medium for transmitting cultural norms and societal roles. However, the pervasive existence of gender stereotypes in these works perpetuates biased perceptions and limits the scope of individuals' identities. Past works have shown that stereotyping and prejudice emerge in early childhood, and developmental research on causal mechanisms is critical for understanding and controlling stereotyping and prejudice. This work contributes by gathering a dataset of rhymes and poems to identify gender stereotypes and propose a model with 97% accuracy to identify gender bias. Gender stereotypes were rectified using a Large Language Model (LLM) and its effectiveness was evaluated in a comparative survey against human educator rectifications. To summarize, this work highlights the pervasive nature of gender stereotypes in literary works and reveals the potential of LLMs to rectify gender stereotypes. This study raises awareness and promotes inclusivity within artistic expressions, making a significant contribution to the discourse on gender equality.}",2024,"2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC-COLING 2024 - Main Conference Proceedings","{bias,gender stereotypes,large-language models}",Mathematics,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Predicting political attitudes from web tracking data: a machine learning approach,"{Anecdotal evidence suggests that the surge of populism and subsequent political polarization might make voters’ political preferences more detectable from digital trace data. This potential scenario could expose voters to the risk of being targeted and easily influenced by political actors. This study investigates the linkage between over 19,000,000 website visits, tracked from 1,003 users in Germany, and their survey responses to explore whether website choices can accurately predict political attitudes across five dimensions: Immigration, democracy, issues (such as climate and the European Union), populism, and trust. Our findings indicate a limited ability to identify political attitudes from individuals’ website visits. Our most effective machine learning algorithm predicted interest in politics and attitudes toward democracy but with dependency on model parameters. Although website categories exhibited suggestive patterns, they only marginally distinguished between individuals with anti- or pro-immigration attitudes, as well as those with populist or mainstream attitudes. This further confirm the reliability of surveys in measuring attitudes compared to digital trace data and, from a normative perspective, suggests that the potential to extract sensitive political information from online behavioral data, which could be utilized for microtargeting, remains limited.}",2024,Journal of Information Technology and Politics,"{life-style, immigration, climate change, democracy, european union,machine learning,political attitudes,surveys,web tracking data}",Social Sciences,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",1.0
Asking for Traces: A Vignette Study on Acceptability Norms and Personal Willingness to Donate Digital Trace Data,"{Digital trace data are increasingly used in the social sciences. Given the risks associated with data access via application programming interfaces (APIs) as well as ethical discussions around the use of such data, data donations have been proposed as a methodologically reliable and ethically sound way of collecting digital trace data. While data donations have many advantages, study participants may be reluctant to share their data, for example, due to privacy concerns. To assess which factors in a data donation request are relevant for participants’ acceptance and decisions, we conducted a vignette experiment investigating the general acceptability and personal willingness to donate various data types (i.e., data from GPS, web browsing, LinkedIn/Xing, Facebook, and TikTok) for research purposes. The preregistered study was implemented in the probability-based German Internet Panel (GIP) and gathered responses from n = 3821 participants. Results show that people rate the general acceptability of data donation requests higher than their own willingness to donate data. Regarding the different data types, respondents indicated that they would be more willing to donate their LinkedIn/Xing, TikTok, and GPS data compared to web browsing and Facebook data. In contrast, information about whether the donated data would be shared with other researchers and data security did not affect the responses to the respective donation scenarios. Based on these results, we discuss implications for studies employing data donations.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,"{data donation,data linkage,data sharing consent,digital trace data,privacy attitudes,vignette experiment}",,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",1.0
"Putting authoritarianism in context: A multilevel analysis of regional effects on individual expressions of right-wing authoritarianism, conspiracy mentality, and superstition","{Ever since its original conception, authoritarianism is claimed to be the driving force behind various forms of anti-modern attitudes and politics. While current research mainly focuses on three dimensions of right-wing authoritarianism, namely authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, and conventionalism, the original F-scale was more extensive, including conspiracy mentality and superstition among others. Based on recent empirical observations as well as theoretical claims, this chapter suggests revisiting these concepts. Using a German representative sample (N = 2,522), notable differences between East and West Germany for all five subdimensions were observed in 2022. Multilevel analyses were used to identify and disentangle individual factors as well as sociostructural context factors, which may be responsible for these differences and codetermine the prevalence of the dimensions of authoritarian attitudes. Our analyses reveal that significant regional differences, which go beyond mere East-West differences in authoritarian attitudes in Germany, can partly be explained by the selected context variables. Moreover, collective experiences of deprivation interact with average household income on the district level, and this interaction helps predict authoritarian aggression and submission as well as conspiracy mentality. Nevertheless, individual variables explain more variance overall than contextual variables, particularly in the case of conspiracy mentality and superstition.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.6132322649729061
Measuring Intellectual Curiosity across Cultures: Validity and Comparability of a New Scale in Six Languages,"{Intellectual curiosity—the tendency to seek out and engage in opportunities for effortful cognitive activity—is a crucial construct in educational research and beyond. Measures of intellectual curiosity vary widely in psychometric quality, and few measures have demonstrated validity and comparability of scores across multiple languages. We analyzed a novel, six-item intellectual curiosity scale (ICS) originally developed for cross-national comparisons in the context of the OECD’s Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC). Samples from six countries representing six national languages (U.S. Germany, France, Spain, Poland, and Japan; total N = 5,557) confirmed that the ICS possesses very good psychometric properties. The scale is essentially unidimensional and showed excellent reliability estimates. On top of factorial validity, the scale demonstrated strict measurement invariance across demographic segments (gender, age groups, and educational strata) and at least partial scalar invariance across countries. As per its convergent and divergent associations with a broad range of constructs (e.g., Open-Mindedness and other Big Five traits, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Job Orientations, and Vocational Interests), it also showed convincing construct validity. Given its internal and external relationships, we recommend the ICS for assessing intellectual curiosity, especially in cross-cultural research applications, yet we also point out future research areas.}",2024,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Psychology,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.192889214629607
"Religion, spirituality, and susceptibility to conspiracy theories: Examining the role of analytic thinking and post-critical beliefs","{The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the political and scholarly attention on conspiracy theories. Among other predictors, religious and spiritual influences on conspiracy beliefs have been widely discussed in the literature. We suggest analyzing the relationship between religion and spirituality on the one hand and conspiracy beliefs on the other hand from the perspective of religious information processing. Based on the Post-Critical Beliefs Scale (PCBS), we argue that literal interpretations of religious information are positively associated with conspiracy beliefs. Furthermore, we assume that individual differences in analytic cognitive style account for the relationship between religious attitudes, spirituality, and conspiracism. Using a quota sample of German adults, we find that literal interpretations of religious content positively correlate with conspiracy beliefs for the literal affirmation of transcendence (e.g., orthodoxy) and the literal disaffirmation of transcendence (e.g., atheism). These findings suggest that religious information processing is related to conspiracy beliefs for religious and nonreligious individuals. Moreover, our results show a stable association between holistic spirituality and conspiracy beliefs. The relationships between different types of religious attitudes, spirituality, and conspiracy beliefs hold, even after accounting for analytic (versus intuitive) thinking. The implications for the study of religious attitudes and conspiracy beliefs are discussed.}",2024,Politics and Religion,"{analytic cognitive style,conspiracy beliefs,conspiracy mentality,holistic spirituality,post-critical beliefs}",Social Sciences,SS,10,"covid 19 pandemic, trust, actor, social science, hybrid",0.13323750011003302
"Need for cognitive closure, political trust, and belief in conspiracy theories during the COVID-19 pandemic","{Introduction: This research examines the effect of individual differences in the need for cognitive closure and political trust on the endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories. We hypothesize that individuals high in cognitive closure and low in political trust will seize on conspiracy accounts of the pandemic. In contrast, we expect that individuals high in cognitive closure and political trust are more likely to disregard conspiracies surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: To test our preregistered hypotheses, we rely on data from multiple waves of a representative survey among the German population (N = 2,883). The need for cognitive closure and general political trust was assessed before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, while belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and specific trust in handling the crisis was fielded during the second wave of the pandemic. Results: We find that individuals with a high need for cognitive closure are more likely to accept conspiracy narratives, but the effect size is small. At the same time, pre-pandemic trust and concurrent trust in political and medical institutions are strongly negatively related to conspiracy beliefs. We find no support for a moderating effect of political trust. Conclusion: This study finds only small effects for individual differences in the need for cognitive closure but strong effects for political trust in explaining conspiracy beliefs. It underlines the importance of a lack of trust in political institutions for democratic societies in the age of misinformation and post-truth politics.}",2024,Frontiers in Social Psychology,"{cognitive style,conspiracy beliefs,coronavirus,covid-19,need for cognitive closure,political trust}",Psychology,SS,10,"covid 19 pandemic, trust, actor, social science, hybrid",0.20354785282985643
Measuring Global Character Dimensions: An Ant Colony Optimization Approach toward Three Core Strength Scales,"{The Values in Action (VIA) framework encompasses 24 universally valued character strengths. Recent factor-analytic work has identified three global core strengths (metatraits) that proved to be well-interpretable and cross-culturally replicable: positivity, dependability, and mastery. However, there are no short scales to economically measure these core strengths that would encourage (large-scale) survey-based research on the global level of the VIA trait space. In the present study, we selected 18 items to measure the three metatraits from the 96-item IPIP-VIA-R inventory. To optimize the item selection while considering multiple psychometric criteria simultaneously, we made use of Ant Colony Optimization. Thereby, we obtained balanced-keyed scales that cover the heterogeneous constructs well, showed good model fit and reliability across six samples from Germany and the U.K. (total N = 2,754), and achieved scalar measurement invariance across countries. Furthermore, we demonstrated each scale’s validity by locating the three core strengths in a nomological net with personality and value metatraits, life satisfaction, and behavioral criteria. Available in the public domain in English and German, these both valid and economical core strength scales may further stimulate integrative research on personality and values.}",2024,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Environmental Science,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.661832961598016
Harmony or Cacophony? A Disaggregated Analysis of Aid Fragmentation,"{Aid effectiveness is widely understood to suffer when multiple donors operate in the same space, but recent studies indicate benefits of fragmentation. We posit that these mixed findings may reflect differences across aid sectors — and also show how the level of implementation can condition the interpretation of results. Cross-national time-series analysis of 152 countries implies aid fragmentation can promote child survival and improve governance. However, analysis of subnational variation in Sierra Leone and Nigeria suggests the presence of more donors is associated with worse health outcomes, but better governance outcomes. Having more donors in a locality may thus be beneficial when they are working to improve the systems through which policies are implemented, but harmful if they target policy outcomes directly. A survey of Nigerian civil servants suggests potential mechanisms: fragmentation in health aid may lead to internal “brain drain” and pressure to alter projects, whereas diversity in governance aid might promote meritocratic behavior.}",2024,Studies in Comparative International Development,"{africa,aid effectiveness,development assistance,foreign aid,governance}",Social Sciences,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",0.29139087203253267
"Unravelling the relationship between employment, social transfers and income poverty: Policy and measurement","{Despite the rise in employment, consistently high EU-average poverty rates continue to generate debates about the factors that explain the level and changes in the relative poverty rate, both within and across countries. Assuming a strong negative correlation between poverty and employment, the article investigates the role of four mechanisms responsible for this blurred relationship. Using decomposition analysis and macro-level regression analysis, we investigate the extent to which (i) the distribution of employment across households with different levels of work intensity, (ii) the expansion of non-standard work, (iii) the change in the effectiveness of social welfare systems, and (iv) the change in median income and the corresponding shift in the poverty threshold have contributed to changes in relative income poverty in the last decades. We found that employment growth benefits poverty reduction, but this positive effect was partially offset by the precarious characteristics of some newly created jobs. If the distribution of jobs had favoured the jobless more in the pre-crisis period, the relative income poverty rate would have been lower. Although the share of persons in jobless households decreased during the recovery years, their risk of poverty increased due to the retrenchment of social transfers during and after the Great Recession. Furthermore, the use of a floating threshold, which is linked to changes in median income, underestimates the strength of the relationships between poverty, employment and social transfers: when the poverty threshold is kept fixed, not only do the dynamics of poverty look different, but the estimated coefficients are considerably larger.}",2024,Journal of European Social Policy,"{employment,european union,fixed-effects panel regression,median income,relative income poverty,social transfers}",Environmental Science,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Introduction,"{German unification can be viewed as a case study when it comes to analyzing transformation processes. To understand and investigate these processes, this chapter follows two main goals. First, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of the historical setting. This introduction thus serves as an overarching chapter, giving a short overview of differences in political systems and ideology during the time of the German separation, the rapprochement and transformation process as well as discussions about possible causes for persisting differences. It will explain how the perspectives taken in the following parts and individual chapters tie together to form a picture of transformation processes in Germany. Second, this chapter serves as a methodological guide through different statistical approaches that may be used to analyze societal and individual changes over time by pointing out common pitfalls of study designs and methods used in transformation research. After giving an overview of methods used in the past, the datasets and methods used in this volume are introduced.

Investigating respondents’ willingness to participate in video-based web surveys,"{Recent developments in communication technology and changes in people’s communication habits facilitate new data collection forms in web surveys. Technical devices, such as computers, tablets, and smartphones, enable researchers to rethink established communication forms and add a human touch to web surveys. Designing web surveys more human-like has the great potential to make communication between researchers and respondents more natural, which may result in higher survey satisfaction and data quality. Considering the existing survey literature, there are only a few studies investigating respondents’ willingness for new communication forms in web surveys. Hence, in the present study, we explore respondents’ willingness to take part in web surveys to have interviewers read questions via pre-recorded videos (question delivery) and in which respondents provide their answers orally via self-recorded videos (question answering). We included two willingness questions – one on question delivery via pre-recorded videos and one on question answering via self-recorded videos – in the non-probability SoSci panel in Germany. The results reveal that respondents’ willingness to have questions read by interviewers is higher than their willingness to self-record video answers. Believing that technology facilitates communication and perceiving the survey as being interesting increases willingness, whereas evaluating the survey topic as sensitive decreases willingness. Personality traits do not play a role when it comes to respondents’ willingness, except for extraversion.}",2024,International Journal of Market Research,"{automatic question reading,non-probability panel,respondent willingness,self-recording answers,survey devices,web surveys}","Economics, Econometrics and Finance",SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.01438266406899618
SEQUENTIAL AND CONCURRENT MIXED-MODE DESIGNS: A TAILORED APPROACH,"{Due to rising costs and declining response rates, surveys are increasingly moving from face-to-face interviewing to a self-administered mixed-mode design. Mixed-mode surveys can be conducted using a concurrent or a sequential design. A sequential design in which the web mode is offered first is a common strategy for mixed-mode surveys as it reduces survey costs. However, when deciding which mode choice sequence to use, sample balance should also be considered. One approach to achieving a balanced sample might be to tailor the sequence of the choice of modes, or the mode choice sequence. For this purpose, we use an indicator that assigns the sampled persons to the different mode choice sequences to minimize the variability of response probabilities. In this study, we compare the sample composition achieved with a concurrent and a sequential design. Additionally, we investigate whether indicator-based tailoring of the two mode choice sequences can improve sample composition. We implemented a randomized experiment in the 2021 German General Social Survey (ALLBUS), which surveyed the general population aged 18 and older in private households (N 5,342) using a mixed-mode design (web and mail). In a first step, respondents were randomly assigned to a concurrent or a sequential design. We find that the two mode choice sequences lead to a similar sample composition. Next, we identify age as the best available single indicator of the variables known before the survey to tailor the mode choice sequence. Our analyses show that a tailored approach based on age improves the sample composition slightly.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,,Mathematics,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",1.0

Mainstreaming the populist radical right?

We contribute to this classic debate by analyzing the web browsing histories and survey responses of six thousand study participants in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK during the 2019 European Parliament election. Linking direct measures of online news exposure to voting behavior allows us to assess the effects of the salience of issues politicized by RRPPs on their electoral support. The likelihood to vote for RRPPs was higher when the EU was more salient in individual media diets, while exposure to the less salient issue of immigration did not increase the propensity to vote for RRPPs. Alongside consistent results for other party families and interactions with pre-existing voting intentions, the findings indicate that the electoral effects of online media are contingent on the overall salience of a specific issue and voters’ predispositions.}",2024,European Political Science Review,"{european parliament election,euroscepticism,immigration,media exposure,populist radical right,voting behavior}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.09575343748594795
"Changes in economic deprivation and parental self-efficacy: Unemployment, poverty, and the mediating effect of psychological distress","{Objective: The article investigates the influence of three aspects of economic deprivation on parental selfefficacy, and whether, or to what extent, these effects are mediated by psychological distress. Background: Scholarship shows that psychological resources such as parental self-efficacy can attenuate the negative repercussions of poverty for families. The article builds on the family stress model that higlights the role of economic deprivation for family functioning by Conger and colleagues. It focuses on the consequences of transitioning into unemployment, objective poverty, and subjective poverty for parental selfefficacy, and the potential mediating effect of psychological distress. Method: Using data from the German Family Panel (pairfam) Waves 4 to 12 (2011–2020), Baron and Kenny mediation analyses are conducted based on fixed effects regressions with standard errors based on clustered bootstrap procedure. Results: The results show that transitioning into subjective poverty significantly decreases parental selfefficacy, and that only a marginal part of this effect is mediated by psychological distress. A transition into objective poverty, by contrast, has no effect on parental self-efficacy. Likewise, unemployment has no direct effect on parental self-efficacy. However, transitioning into short-term unemployment reduces psychological distress and thereby buffers parent’s self-efficacy. This does by contrast not apply for long-term unemployment. Conclusion: The findings demonstrate the importance of differentiating between specific aspects of economic deprivation when investigating its consequences for parental self-efficacy and considering psychological distress as a potential mediator. Moreover, the findings provide longitudinal evidence for the consequences of a transition into economic deprivation for parental self-efficacy and point to the presence of gender effects with regard to unemployment.}",2024,Journal of Family Research,"{economic deprivation,family stress model,fixed-effects models,mediation analysis,objective and subjective poverty,parental self-efficacy,psychological distress,unemployment}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Measuring the Four Higher-Order Values in Schwartz’s Theory: Validation of a 17-Item Inventory,"{Schwartz’s theory of basic human values is the dominant framework for assessing values. One of its strengths is that it allows for different levels of analysis. The 10 basic values can be reliably assigned to four higher-order dimensions: Openness to Change, Conservation, Self-Transcendence, and Self-Enhancement. In this paper, we examined the psychometric properties of the Higher-Order-Value Scale-17 (HOVS17), an inventory that economically assesses these higher-order values. We analyzed data from the GESIS Panel, an ongoing large-scale probability-based panel study that fields HOVS17 annually since 2013 and for which HOVS17 was originally developed. We found HOVS17 to have satisfactory psychometric properties. The 17 items were located in the two-dimensional multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) space as hypothesized. All four subscales were unidimensional, showed good fit when modeled as reflective latent variables, and had acceptable reliabilities as well as one-year test–retest stabilities (.65 to.69). The subscales correlated in theoretically plausible ways with a wide range of correlates and criteria, such as personality traits and well-being. This demonstrates that HOVS17 provides a sound basis for studying the development, precursors, and consequences of the higher-order values in the GESIS Panel and in future surveys that adopt HOVS17.

United in disagreement: Analyzing policy networks in EU policy making,"{Shared belief systems are generally assumed to forge policy networks. Empirical evidence whether and to what extend shared policy core beliefs create ally networks and under which circumstances shared policy core beliefs are not necessary to form these networks, however, is limited. Based on a novel inferential network approach in combination with mediation analysis, this study investigates the role of belief systems as a link between interest group type and policy preference congruence, ultimately leading to ally networks in the European Union. In order to measure the intervening effect of policy core beliefs, automated text analysis is used. Our results suggest that shared policy core beliefs are a strong mediator for members of the same interest group. In addition, “strange bedfellow” networks between NGOs and businesses do, in fact, lack belief congruence and emerge on issues with low potential for intergroup conflict. This paper makes a contribution to our understanding of ally network formation and adds to the emerging line of research which combines quantitative text with inferential network analysis.}",2024,Review of Policy Research,"{advocacy coalitions,automated text analysis,eu energy policy,inferential network analysis,interest groups}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.026876249870869163

The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale: Cross-National Measurement Invariance and Convergent Validity Evidence,"{Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS)is a widely used measure that captures somatic symptoms of coronavirus- related anxiety. In a large-scale collaboration spanning 60 countries (Ntotal = 21,513), we examined the CAS’s measurement invariance and assessed the convergent validity of CAS scores in relation to the fear of COVID-19(FCV-19S) and the satisfaction with life (SWLS-3) scales. We utilized both conventional exact invariance tests and alignmentprocedures,with results revealing that the single-factor model fit the data well in almost all countries. Partial scalar invariance was supported in a subset of 56 countries. To ensure the robustness of results, given the unbalanced samples, we employed resampling techniques both with and without replacement and found the results were more stable in larger samples. The alignment procedure demonstrated a high degree of measurement invariance with 9% of the parameters exhibiting non-invariance. Wealso conducted simulations of alignment using the parameters estimated in the current model. Findings demonstrated reliability of the means but indicated challenges in estimating the latent variances. Strong positive correlations between CAS and FCV-19S estimated with all three different approaches were found in most countries. Correlations of CAS and SWLS-3were weakandnegativebutsignificantly differed from zero in several countries. Overall, the study provided support for the measurement invariance of the CAS and offered evidence of its convergent validity while also highlighting issues with variance estimation.}",2024,Psychological Assessment,"{alignment,coronavirus anxiety,culture,measurement invariance,validity}",Psychology,SS,10,"covid 19 pandemic, trust, actor, social science, hybrid",1.0
Individual and gender inequality in computer science: A career study of cohorts from 1970 to 2000,"{Inequality prevails in science. Individual inequality means that most perish quickly and only a few are successful, and gender inequality implies that there are differences in achievements for women and men. Using large-scale bibliographic data and following a computational approach, we study the evolution of individual and gender inequality for cohorts from 1970 to 2000 in the whole field of computer science as it grows and becomes a team-based science. We find that individual inequality in productivity (publications) increases over a scholar’s career but is historically invariant, whereas individual inequality in impact (citations), albeit larger, is stable across cohorts and careers. Gender inequality prevails regarding productivity, but there is no evidence for differences in impact. The Matthew Effect is shown to accumulate advantages to early achievements and to become stronger over the decades, indicating the rise of a “publish or perish” imperative. Only some authors manage to reap the benefits that publishing in teams promises. The Matthew Effect then amplifies initial differences and propagates the gender gap. Women continue to fall behind because they continue to be at a higher risk of dropping out for reasons that have nothing to do with early-career achievements or social support.}",2024,Quantitative Science Studies,"{careers,cohorts,computer science,gender,inequality,matthew effect}",Social Sciences,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",0.7646796691031228
Introduction,"{German unification can be viewed as a case study when it comes to analyzing transformation processes. To understand and investigate these processes, this chapter follows two main goals. First, it is necessary to have a basic understanding of the historical setting. This introduction thus serves as an overarching chapter, giving a short overview of differences in political systems and ideology during the time of the German separation, the rapprochement and transformation process as well as discussions about possible causes for persisting differences. It will explain how the perspectives taken in the following parts and individual chapters tie together to form a picture of transformation processes in Germany. Second, this chapter serves as a methodological guide through different statistical approaches that may be used to analyze societal and individual changes over time by pointing out common pitfalls of study designs and methods used in transformation research. After giving an overview of methods used in the past, the datasets and methods used in this volume are introduced. The chapter concludes with a critical discussion of past and present methods above and beyond the specific German context.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,19,"chapter, processes, germany, changes, political attitudes",0.7846785129005384

To avoid the correlation between topics and frames, we provide a synthetic dataset for evaluating frames found in multi-topical news content, using the detection of generic frames as a test case. With this dataset, for the first time, we benchmark manual coding and various automatic and semisupervised methods.

Citation prediction by leveraging transformers and natural language processing heuristics,"{In scientific papers, it is common practice to cite other articles to substantiate claims, provide evidence for factual assertions, reference limitations, and research gaps, and fulfill various other purposes. When authors include a citation in a given sentence, there are two considerations they need to take into account: (i) where in the sentence to place the citation and (ii) which citation to choose to support the underlying claim. In this paper, we focus on the first task as it allows multiple potential approaches that rely on the researcher's individual style and the specific norms and conventions of the relevant scientific community. We propose two automatic methodologies that leverage transformers architecture for either solving a Mask-Filling problem or a Named Entity Recognition problem. On top of the results of the proposed methodologies, we apply ad-hoc Natural Language Processing heuristics to further improve their outcome. We also introduce s2orc-9K, an open dataset for fine-tuning models on this task. A formal evaluation demonstrates that the generative approach significantly outperforms five alternative methods when fine-tuned on the novel dataset. Furthermore, this model's results show no statistically significant deviation from the outputs of three senior researchers.}",2024,Information Processing and Management,"{bert,citation prediction,mask-filling,named entity recognition,transformers architecture}",Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",1.0
"Putting authoritarianism in context: A multilevel analysis of regional effects on individual expressions of right-wing authoritarianism, conspiracy mentality, and superstition","{Ever since its original conception, authoritarianism is claimed to be the driving force behind various forms of anti-modern attitudes and politics. While current research mainly focuses on three dimensions of right-wing authoritarianism, namely authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, and conventionalism, the original F-scale was more extensive, including conspiracy mentality and superstition among others. Based on recent empirical observations as well as theoretical claims, this chapter suggests revisiting these concepts. Using a German representative sample (N = 2,522), notable differences between East and West Germany for all five subdimensions were observed in 2022. Multilevel analyses were used to identify and disentangle individual factors as well as sociostructural context factors, which may be responsible for these differences and codetermine the prevalence of the dimensions of authoritarian attitudes. Our analyses reveal that significant regional differences, which go beyond mere East-West differences in authoritarian attitudes in Germany, can partly be explained by the selected context variables. Moreover, collective experiences of deprivation interact with average household income on the district level, and this interaction helps predict authoritarian aggression and submission as well as conspiracy mentality. Nevertheless, individual variables explain more variance overall than contextual variables, particularly in the case of conspiracy mentality and superstition.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.503959175388483

The association between system-justifying ideologies and attitudes toward the social market economy in Germany,"{Although the legitimacy of an economic system is often dependent on citizen support, psychological research has paid little attention to attitudes toward economic systems. In the present study, we examined the link between two system-justifying ideologies, namely, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), and attitudes toward the social market economy in Germany. Drawing on system justification theory, we hypothesized that RWA would be positively and SDO negatively associated with support for the social market economy because the social component of the German economic system conflicts with beliefs inherent in SDO favoring a group-based hierarchy. Based on a quota sample of German adults (N = 886), we found support for the predicted associations of both system-justifying ideologies with economic system support, except that RWA was negatively associated with support for the welfare component of the social market economy. However, the positive relationship of RWA with support for the social market economy only emerged after SDO was statistically controlled, suggesting a suppressor situation. These findings demonstrate that system-justifying ideologies bear different relations to pro-market attitudes depending on the type of economic regime. Implications for system justification theory are discussed.}",2024,Current Psychology,"{capitalism,political ideology,right-wing authoritarianism,social dominance orientation,social market economy,system justification}",,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.2693901302734219
The Performance of Multiple Imputation in Social Surveys with Missing Data from Planned Missingness and Item Nonresponse,"{This paper studies the quality of estimates from multiple imputation for the case of social survey data that combines planned missing data with missing data from conventional item nonresponse by survey partici-pants. To this end, the paper uses a Monte Carlo simulation study on real data from the German Internet Panel. In this data, missingness is simulated based on item nonresponse with different mechanisms and proportions of item nonresponse as well as different proportions of planned missing data. Our results show that item nonresponse can jeopardize the quality of estimates after multiple imputation especially when the total amount of missing data from both sources is high or when there is a considerable proportion of item nonresponse that is missing not at random. Therefore, from an imputation perspective, survey designers should incorporate their expectations about item nonresponse on each variable when designing surveys with planned missing data.}",2024,Survey Research Methods,"{imputation,item nonresponse,planned missing data,split questionnaire design}",Social Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.06488130055893852

Gendered wage returns to changes in non-routine job tasks: Evidence from Germany,"{The labor market exhibits persistent occupational segregation by gender, with women and men performing distinct job tasks within their occupations. Prior research suggests that non-routine job tasks generally lead to higher wages, especially in digitally advancing contexts. However, these findings are largely based on cross-sectional data and neglect gender as a relevant dimension of inequality. We analyze three-wave panel data over nine years from the German National Educational Panel Study to explore the relationship between changes in non-routine job tasks and wages by gender. Given the constrained wage-setting opportunities within German firms, we further examine whether the association between task changes and wages differs for employees with and without job changes, both within and across occupational segments. Our fixed-effect regression analyses reveal gender-specific associations between changes in non-routine job tasks and wage increases. Men benefit from performing more complex and autonomous tasks, with additional gains when an inter-segmental job change accompanies the increase in complex job tasks. Conversely, women do not see wage benefits from enhancements in either complex or autonomous job tasks. These findings underscore the gendered patterns of wage increases associated with advancements in non-routine job tasks, with men profiting intra-individually from shifts towards more non-routine job tasks.}",2024,Research in Social Stratification and Mobility,"{gender segregation,job changes,neps,occupational segregation,panel data,technological change}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.4129664499291094

The (fe-)male breadwinner? Beliefs about gender roles in East Germany: An age-period-cohort analysis,"{Background: Beliefs about gender roles develop in a complex interplay of individual factors with the sociopolitical and historical context. They differ between birth cohorts, depend on individual age, and change over time. In recent years, a certain retraditionalization was observed, especially in younger East German birth cohorts. This study investigates whether younger cohorts indeed show more traditional beliefs when considering age and period effects as well as sociodemographic factors. Methods: Using data from seven cross sections (1992 to 2016) of an East German sample of the German General Social Survey (N = 5,426), hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) analyses were applied to simultaneously estimate the effects of age, birth cohort, and time period on gender role beliefs. Results: Significant cohort effects were observed, with those cohorts born and raised in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) showing the most egalitarian views. Similar to the oldest cohorts, the youngest cohorts exhibited more traditional beliefs. Conclusion: The results indeed suggest a trend toward retraditionalization of the gender role beliefs in the generations born after the end of the GDR compared to those born during its existence. Implications as well as limitations of the HAPC method are critically discussed.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Tit for tat? EU risk-sharing and experienced reciprocity,"{As with previous crises, EU-wide risk-sharing has also been demanded during the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, this crisis did not unfold in a political vacuum. Instead, public backing for EU-wide risk-sharing might have been informed by past crises experiences. Building on the idea of experienced reciprocal risk-sharing, we assume that the willingness to share risks is greater when a crisis-ridden country has also shown solidarity before, whereas readiness to cooperate may be mitigated by non-solidarity-oriented behaviour in the past. We test this assumption based on a survey experiment carried out in eleven EU countries in 2020. Our findings suggest that, when people are given information about whether another country has acted in solidarity in the past, this influences their willingness to support risk-sharing in the present. However, we also find evidence that respondents’ preferences outside the experimental setting do not always match their country's recent history of reciprocal risk-sharing.}",2024,Journal of European Public Policy,"{collective memory,covid-19,crises,eu,reciprocity,risk-sharing}",Social Sciences,SS,25,"risk, children, immigration, 19 pandemic, 2020",1.0
CooRTweet: A Generalized R Software for Coordinated Network Detection,"{This paper introduces CooRTweet, an innovative R package designed for detecting and analyzing coordinated behavior. CooRTweet’s distinctiveness lies in its essential architecture, derived from a minimal definition of coordinated behavior that captures its core elements in an abstract way. This approach makes it possible for the tool to be applied to the widest range of cases, from mono-modal network analysis on a single social media platform, to multi-modal and cross-platform network analysis, and to any types of objects shared by a network, whether singular identical objects (e.g., the same tweet), similar objects (e.g., clusters of similar images), or complex objects (e.g., a combination of hashtags, images, and emojis). Additionally, it offers a comprehensive view of coordinated activities that include both explicit coordination and organic forms of content sharing. The comprehensive architecture of CooRTweet provides flexibility and a broad scope for analyzing coordinated activities across various digital landscapes. This positions it as a distinctive resource for researchers investigating coordinated communication online. More generally, CooRTweet provides a valuable example to methodologists and research tool developers of how software tools for research can be developed in a generalized and thus flexible way. This is particularly important for social media research, given how quickly new APIs are being released, modified, and even shut down. This paper aims to provide an introduction to CooRTweet and the analysis of coordinated behavior, demonstrating the software’s application through a case study of cross-platform coordinated behavior during the 2021 German elections.}",2024,Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean,"{coordinated behavior,information campaigns,network analysis,social media}",Social Sciences,SS,26,"discourse, social media, polarization, scenarios, election",1.0
Archiving and Temporal Analysis of Behavioral Web Data - Tales from the Inside,"{Behavioral web data such as social web activity streams, query logs or behavioral traces from web search and navigation are crucial to understand the temporal evolution of the web and the human interactions that produce web data and models trained on such data. Thus, behavioral web data empowers research in various fields, such as (temporal) information retrieval, computational social science or cognitive and behavioral modeling of users over time. On the other hand, archiving and using such kind of data is associated with a number of technical and non-technical challenges, e.g. legal and ethical concerns, fast decay of data over time, as well as dependency on 3rd party gatekeepers, such as Twitter/X or Google. We present case studies from many years of research into archiving and temporal analysis of behavioral web data, including large-scale social web archives such as TweetsKB, based on an archive of 14 bn tweets harvested continuously since 2013, and web search and navigation behavior tracked through user studies, longitudinal panels or crowdsourcing-based quasi experiments.}",2024,WWW 2024 Companion - Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference,,Computer Science,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",1.0
Toeing the Party Line: Election Manifestos as a Key to Understand Political Discourse on Twitter,"{Political discourse on Twitter is a moving target: politicians continuously make statements about their positions. It is therefore crucial to track their discourse on social media to understand their ideological positions and goals. However, Twitter data is also challenging to work with since it is ambiguous and often dependent on social context, and consequently, recent work on political positioning has tended to focus strongly on manifestos (parties' electoral programs) rather than social media. In this paper, we extend recently proposed methods to predict pairwise positional similarities between parties from the manifesto case to the Twitter case, using hashtags as a signal to fine-tune text representations, without the need for manual annotation. We verify the efficacy of fine-tuning and conduct a series of experiments that assess the robustness of our method for low-resource scenarios. We find that our method yields stable positioning reflective of manifesto positioning, both in scenarios with all tweets of candidates across years available and when only smaller subsets from shorter time periods are available. This indicates that it is possible to reliably analyze the relative positioning of actors forgoing manual annotation, even in the noisier context of social media.}",2024,"EMNLP 2024 - 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Findings of EMNLP 2024",,Social Sciences,SS,26,"discourse, social media, polarization, scenarios, election",1.0

Approaches to the measurement of individual social capital in general social surveys,"{Three main approaches dominate the field of measuring individual social capital: the name generator, excelling in measuring strong ties; the resource generator, focusing on capturing social support; the position generator, reflecting social capital embedded in social hierarchies. Each of these measures has its unique scientific merit making it tempting to use all of them in the same study. Because these measurement instruments typically consist of a multitude of items this often will not be an option. Therefore it is of great importance to understand the core concepts behind these measurement approaches, their different variants and their strengths and weaknesses. While aiming at the greatest possible precision of measurement survey practitioners, nonetheless, face severe limitations, in particular concerning length and mode of the planned survey. Based on our experience of having implemented social capital measures in multiple surveys, we discuss different measures that balance difficulty and performance.}",2024,Handbook on Inequality and Social Capital,"{cross-national measurement,general social survey,name generator,position generator,resource generator,social capital}",,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",0.39105212343604384
Why we need to abandon fixed cutoffs for goodness-of-fit indices: An extensive simulation and possible solutions,"{To evaluate model fit in confirmatory factor analysis, researchers compare goodness-of-fit indices (GOFs) against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI >.950) derived from simulation studies. Methodologists have cautioned that cutoffs for GOFs are only valid for settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which cutoffs originated. Despite these warnings, fixed cutoffs for popular GOFs (i.e., χ2, χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) continue to be widely used in applied research. We (1) argue that the practice of using fixed cutoffs needs to be abandoned and (2) review time-honored and emerging alternatives to fixed cutoffs. We first present the most in-depth simulation study to date on the sensitivity of GOFs to model misspecification (i.e., misspecified factor dimensionality and unmodeled cross-loadings) and their susceptibility to further data and analysis characteristics (i.e., estimator, number of indicators, number and distribution of response options, loading magnitude, sample size, and factor correlation). We included all characteristics identified as influential in previous studies. Our simulation enabled us to replicate well-known influences on GOFs and establish hitherto unknown or underappreciated ones. In particular, the magnitude of the factor correlation turned out to moderate the effects of several characteristics on GOFs. Second, to address these problems, we discuss several strategies for assessing model fit that take the dependency of GOFs on the modeling context into account. We highlight tailored (or “dynamic”) cutoffs as a way forward. We provide convenient tables with scenario-specific cutoffs as well as regression formulae to predict cutoffs tailored to the empirical setting of interest.}",2024,Behavior Research Methods,"{confirmatory factor analysis,fit index,goodness-of-fit,ordered categorical data,structural equation modeling}",Psychology,SS,21,"modeling, detection, correlation, gender, depth",1.0
Populist Attitudes among Teenagers: How Negative Relationships with Socialization Agents Are Linked to Populist Attitudes,"{While the origins and consequences of populist attitudes in adults are being studied extensively, it is still unknown when populist attitudes might emerge in a person's life.

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of populist attitudes among a representative sample of children aged 12 to 18 (mean: 14.66 years) using a unique dataset gathered through interviews conducted in schools in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland (n=3,123). Our findings reveal a strong association between perceived unjust teacher behavior and the level of populist attitudes in adolescents, while the connection of peers and parents with populist attitudes appears to be limited.

Gender differences in literacy in PIAAC: do assessment features matter?,"{Background: Previous research based on large-scale studies consistently suggests that on average, male students tend to have lower literacy compared to their female students during secondary schooling. However, this gender gap in literacy seems to “disappear” during adulthood. Up until today, only a few studies investigated the role of assessment features in gender differences in literacy performance in adulthood. This study aims to understand the relationship between assessment features and gender differences in literacy skills. Methods: Using the German 2012 PIAAC data (N = 4,512), we applied item-level analyses using linear probability models to examine gender differences in the probability of solving a literacy item correctly with six assessment features including (1) text format, (2) text topics, (3) text length, (4) cognitive strategies, (5) numerical content of the text/questions, and (6) gender typicality of content. Results: We found that men had a 13.4% higher probability of solving items with a noncontinuous text format correctly than women. Men also had a 9.4% higher probability of solving short text items correctly and a 4.6% higher probability of solving items with a medium/high numerical content in the question correctly than women. There were small to negligible gender differences in literacy performance in terms of text topics, cognitive strategies, and gender typicality of content. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the role of text format, text length, and numerical content in gender differences in literacy skills, suggesting that further refining these practices can enhance the fairness and accuracy of literacy assessments. Specifically, we advocate for ongoing research aimed at understanding and minimizing the potential bias introduced by these assessment features. Such efforts are not only crucial for developing instruments that accurately measure literacy skills, but they also yield insights that hold significant implications for educational researchers and practitioners dedicated to creating more equitable assessment environments.}",2024,Large-Scale Assessments in Education,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

The rise of Indo-German collaborative research: 1990–2022,"{Purpose: This study aims to highlight the growth and development of Indo-German collaborative research over the past three decades. Moreover, this study encompasses an in-depth examination of funding acknowledgements to gain valuable insights into the financial support that underpins these collaborative endeavours. Together with this paper, the authors provide an openly accessible data set of Indo-German research papers for further and reproducible research activities (the “Indo-German Literature Dataset”). Design/methodology/approach: The data were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database from the year 1990 till the 30th of November 2022. A total of 36,999 records were retrieved against the used query. Acknowledged entities were extracted using a named entity recognition (NER) model specifically trained for this task. Interrelations between the extracted entities and scientific domains, lengths of acknowledgement texts, number of authors and affiliations, number of citations and gender of the first author, as well as collaboration patterns between Indian and German funders were examined. Findings: The study reveals a consistent and increasing growth in the publication trend over the years. The study brings to light that Physics, Chemistry, Materials Science, Astronomy and Astrophysics and Engineering prominently dominate the Indo-German collaborative research. The USA, followed by England and France, are the most active collaborators in Indian and German research. Largely, research was funded by major German and Indian funding agencies, international corporations and German and American universities. Associations between the first author’s gender and acknowledged entity were observed. Additionally, relations between entity, entity type and scientific domain were discovered. Practical implications: The study paves the way for enhanced collaboration, optimized resource utilization and societal advantages by offering a profound comprehension of the intricacies inherent in research partnerships between India and Germany. Implementation of the insights gleaned from this study holds the promise of cultivating a more resilient and influential collaborative research ecosystem between the two nations. Originality/value: The study highlights a deeper understanding of the composition of the Indo-German collaborative research landscape of the past 30 years and its significance in advancing scientific knowledge and fostering international partnerships. Furthermore, the authors provide an open version of the original WoS data set. The Indo-German Literature Data set consists of 22,844 papers from OpenAlex and is available for related studies like literature studies and scientometrics.}",2024,"Global Knowledge, Memory and Communication","{acknowledgement analysis,indo-german literature,scientific collaboration,scientometrics}",Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
Tit for tat? EU risk-sharing and experienced reciprocity,"{As with previous crises, EU-wide risk-sharing has also been demanded during the Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, this crisis did not unfold in a political vacuum. Instead, public backing for EU-wide risk-sharing might have been informed by past crises experiences. Building on the idea of experienced reciprocal risk-sharing, we assume that the willingness to share risks is greater when a crisis-ridden country has also shown solidarity before, whereas readiness to cooperate may be mitigated by non-solidarity-oriented behaviour in the past. We test this assumption based on a survey experiment carried out in eleven EU countries in 2020. Our findings suggest that, when people are given information about whether another country has acted in solidarity in the past, this influences their willingness to support risk-sharing in the present. However, we also find evidence that respondents’ preferences outside the experimental setting do not always match their country's recent history of reciprocal risk-sharing.}",2024,Journal of European Public Policy,"{collective memory,covid-19,crises,eu,reciprocity,risk-sharing}",Social Sciences,SS,25,"risk, children, immigration, 19 pandemic, 2020",1.0
Individual and gender inequality in computer science: A career study of cohorts from 1970 to 2000,"{Inequality prevails in science. Individual inequality means that most perish quickly and only a few are successful, and gender inequality implies that there are differences in achievements for women and men. Using large-scale bibliographic data and following a computational approach, we study the evolution of individual and gender inequality for cohorts from 1970 to 2000 in the whole field of computer science as it grows and becomes a team-based science. We find that individual inequality in productivity (publications) increases over a scholar’s career but is historically invariant, whereas individual inequality in impact (citations), albeit larger, is stable across cohorts and careers. Gender inequality prevails regarding productivity, but there is no evidence for differences in impact. The Matthew Effect is shown to accumulate advantages to early achievements and to become stronger over the decades, indicating the rise of a “publish or perish” imperative. Only some authors manage to reap the benefits that publishing in teams promises. The Matthew Effect then amplifies initial differences and propagates the gender gap. Women continue to fall behind because they continue to be at a higher risk of dropping out for reasons that have nothing to do with early-career achievements or social support.}",2024,Quantitative Science Studies,"{careers,cohorts,computer science,gender,inequality,matthew effect}",Mathematics,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",0.6980191038271629

Does temporary employment increase length of commuting? Longitudinal evidence from Australia and Germany,"{On average, temporary jobs are far less stable than permanent jobs. This higher instability could potentially lower workers’ incentives to relocate towards the workplace, thereby resulting in longer commutes. However, surprisingly few studies have investigated the link between temporary employment and commuting length. Building on the notion that individuals strive to optimize their utility when deciding where to work and live, we develop and test a theoretical framework that predicts commuting outcomes for different types of temporary workers – fixed-term, casual and temporary agency workers – and in different institutional contexts. We estimate fixed-effects regression models using 17 waves of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). As expected, the results show that the link between temporary employment and commuting length varies by employment type and institutional context. Agency work is associated with longer commutes than permanent work in both countries, whereas this applies to fixed-term contracts for Germany only. For casual work, the findings suggest no commuting length differential to permanent employment. In terms of policy, our findings suggest lengthy commuting can be a side effect of flexible labour markets, with potentially negative implications for worker well-being, transportation management and the environment.}",2024,Transportation,"{casual work,fixed-term contracts,hilda survey,soep,temporary agency work,work-related spatial mobility}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.4118005671520575
"Incivility in Comparison: How Context, Content, and Personal Characteristics Predict Exposure to Uncivil Content","{Incivility, that is, the breaking of social norms of conversation, is evidently prevalent in online political communication. While a growing literature provides evidence on the prevalence of incivility in different online venues, it is still unclear where and to what extent Internet users are exposed to incivility.

The level of incivility is predicted using Google’s Perspective API and compared across contexts (platforms and campaign periods), content features, and individual-level variables. The findings show that incivility is particularly strong on Twitter and more prevalent in comments than original posts/tweets on Facebook and Twitter. Content featuring political content and actors is more uncivil, whereas personal characteristics are less relevant predictors. The finding that user-generated political content is the most likely source of individuals’ exposure to incivility adds to the understanding of social media’s impact on public discourse.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,"{election campaigns,incivility,negativity,political information,social media,web browsing data}",Social Sciences,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",1.0
Investigating respondents’ willingness to participate in video-based web surveys,"{Recent developments in communication technology and changes in people’s communication habits facilitate new data collection forms in web surveys. Technical devices, such as computers, tablets, and smartphones, enable researchers to rethink established communication forms and add a human touch to web surveys. Designing web surveys more human-like has the great potential to make communication between researchers and respondents more natural, which may result in higher survey satisfaction and data quality. Considering the existing survey literature, there are only a few studies investigating respondents’ willingness for new communication forms in web surveys. Hence, in the present study, we explore respondents’ willingness to take part in web surveys to have interviewers read questions via pre-recorded videos (question delivery) and in which respondents provide their answers orally via self-recorded videos (question answering). We included two willingness questions – one on question delivery via pre-recorded videos and one on question answering via self-recorded videos – in the non-probability SoSci panel in Germany. The results reveal that respondents’ willingness to have questions read by interviewers is higher than their willingness to self-record video answers. Believing that technology facilitates communication and perceiving the survey as being interesting increases willingness, whereas evaluating the survey topic as sensitive decreases willingness. Personality traits do not play a role when it comes to respondents’ willingness, except for extraversion.}",2024,International Journal of Market Research,"{automatic question reading,non-probability panel,respondent willingness,self-recording answers,survey devices,web surveys}","Business, Management and Accounting",SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.015396447989204238

We use news engagement as a proxy for familiarity and investigate news articles presented on Google search pages (n = 1221). We find a significant effect of algorithmic factors but not of familiarity. We find that ranking plays a lesser role for news compared to non-news, suggesting a more careful decision-making process.

The Austrian Political Advertisement Scandal: Patterns of “Journalism for Sale”,"{Mounting concern surrounds the influence of political actors on journalism, especially as media outlets face increasing financial pressures. These circumstances can give rise to instances of media capture, a mutually corrupting relationship between political actors and media organizations. However, empirical evidence substantiating such mechanisms and their consequences remains limited, particularly in the context of Western democracies. This chapter investigates a recent case in which a former Austrian chancellor allegedly colluded with a tabloid newspaper to receive better news coverage in exchange for increased ad placements by government institutions. We employ automated content analysis to investigate political news articles from seventeen prominent Austrian news outlets spanning 2012–2021 (n = 222,659). Adopting a difference-in-differences approach, we find a substantial increase in media visibility of the former Austrian chancellor within the news outlet that is alleged to have received bribes, as well as a decrease in favorability for challenger candidates. Although this study does not aim to prove or disprove the involvement of specific political actors or media organizations in unethical or illegal activities, it introduces an innovative method for detecting unusual patterns in media reporting. Findings are discussed in the context of current threats to media independence and underscore the crucial need to protect journalistic integrity and ensure unbiased information for the public.}",2024,International Journal of Press/Politics,"{bribes,computational text analysis,difference-in-differences,media capture,media corruption,media independence}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",1.0
Misclassification in Automated Content Analysis Causes Bias in Regression. Can We Fix It? Yes We Can!,"{Automated classifiers (ACs), often built via supervised machine learning (SML), can categorize large, statistically powerful samples of data ranging from text to images and video. They have become widely popular measurement devices in communication science and related fields. Despite this popularity, even highly accurate classifiers make errors that cause misclassification bias and misleading results when input to downstream statistical analyses–unless such analyses account for these errors. As we show in a systematic literature review of SML applications, communication scholars largely ignore misclassification bias. In principle, existing statistical methods can use “gold standard” validation data, such as that created by human annotators, to correct misclassification bias. We introduce and test such methods, including a new method we design and implement in the R package misclassification_models, via Monte Carlo simulations designed to reveal each method’s limitations, which we also release. Based on our results, we recommend our new error correction method as it is versatile and efficient. In sum, automated classifiers, even those below common accuracy standards or those making systematic misclassifications, can be useful for measurement with careful study design and appropriate error correction methods.}",2024,Communication Methods and Measures,,Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
Improving media trust research through better measurement: An item response theory perspective,"{While trust in news media has come to the forefront of scholarly and public debate in recent years, academic researchers have raised persistent concern that measurement issues have prevented a better understanding of the concept. This research introduces an item response theory (IRT) perspective to advance the state-of-the-art in media trust measurement beyond recent conceptual and analytical progress. I argue that standard survey instruments that concentrate on the perceived believability of news media restrict our capability to measure truly low media trust. Furthermore, I suggest an important yet previously unnoticed pathway to overcoming this restriction in a scale by Abdulla et al. that captures currency perceptions alongside believability perceptions. Using a representative survey conducted in Germany, I find robust empirical evidence that capturing currency vs. believability perceptions significantly impacts our ability to accurately measure lower vs. higher levels of media trust. The findings have implications for not only studies of media trust’s associations with antecedent and consequential constructs but any attempt to determine the true amount and divergence of citizens’ media trust. More generally, the results demonstrate how IRT aids in putting scholarly debates on the dimensionality and interplay of trust with distrust on more common and fruitful grounds.}",2024,Journal of Trust Research,"{confirmatory item factor analysis,item response theory,measurement,media trust,news credibility,news media,survey research}",Psychology,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",1.0

"CONCURRENT, WEB-FIRST, OR WEB-ONLY? HOW DIFFERENT MODE SEQUENCES PERFORM IN RECRUITING PARTICIPANTS FOR A SELF-ADMINISTERED MIXED-MODE PANEL STUDY","{During the COVID-19 pandemic, many survey programs switched to self-administered modes of data collection, often offering respondents both web-based and paper-based questionnaires. However, there is little guidance as to when to offer which mode, especially when the aim is to recruit participants for a panel survey. This study examines the effectiveness of different mode-sequence designs by analyzing an experiment implemented in the recruitment wave of the German panel study ""Family Research and Demographic Analysis.""We randomly assigned 108,256 individuals aged 18-49 years to one of three mode-sequence-design conditions: concurrent, web-first including a paper-based questionnaire with the second reminder (web-first-2), and web-first including a paper-based questionnaire with the third reminder (web-first-3). A fourth, simulated group did not receive a paper-based questionnaire (web-only). We analyzed how different mode-sequence designs affected outcome rates, sample composition, response distributions, data quality, share of paper-based questionnaires, postage costs, number of postal mailings in the recruitment wave, and participation in the first regular wave. Our results show no differences in response distributions and small differences in sample composition across the four mode-sequence designs. As the web-first-2 and simulated web-only designs yielded comparatively good response and recruitment rates at reasonable costs, we recommend their use when surveying adults between 18 and 49years old.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{mixed-mode,mode-choice design,panel survey,recruitment experiment,self-administered modes}",Mathematics,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",1.0
Does temporary employment increase length of commuting? Longitudinal evidence from Australia and Germany,"{On average, temporary jobs are far less stable than permanent jobs. This higher instability could potentially lower workers’ incentives to relocate towards the workplace, thereby resulting in longer commutes. However, surprisingly few studies have investigated the link between temporary employment and commuting length. Building on the notion that individuals strive to optimize their utility when deciding where to work and live, we develop and test a theoretical framework that predicts commuting outcomes for different types of temporary workers – fixed-term, casual and temporary agency workers – and in different institutional contexts. We estimate fixed-effects regression models using 17 waves of data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey and the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). As expected, the results show that the link between temporary employment and commuting length varies by employment type and institutional context. Agency work is associated with longer commutes than permanent work in both countries, whereas this applies to fixed-term contracts for Germany only. For casual work, the findings suggest no commuting length differential to permanent employment. In terms of policy, our findings suggest lengthy commuting can be a side effect of flexible labour markets, with potentially negative implications for worker well-being, transportation management and the environment.}",2024,Transportation,"{casual work,fixed-term contracts,hilda survey,soep,temporary agency work,work-related spatial mobility}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.4214213285031024
Revisiting The Classics: A Study on Identifying and Rectifying Gender Stereotypes in Rhymes and Poems,"{Rhymes and poems are a powerful medium for transmitting cultural norms and societal roles. However, the pervasive existence of gender stereotypes in these works perpetuates biased perceptions and limits the scope of individuals' identities. Past works have shown that stereotyping and prejudice emerge in early childhood, and developmental research on causal mechanisms is critical for understanding and controlling stereotyping and prejudice. This work contributes by gathering a dataset of rhymes and poems to identify gender stereotypes and propose a model with 97% accuracy to identify gender bias. Gender stereotypes were rectified using a Large Language Model (LLM) and its effectiveness was evaluated in a comparative survey against human educator rectifications. To summarize, this work highlights the pervasive nature of gender stereotypes in literary works and reveals the potential of LLMs to rectify gender stereotypes.

How does broadband supply affect participation in panel surveys?: Using geospatial broadband data at the district level to analyze mode choice and panel attrition,"{Good broadband supply is crucial for different aspects of participation behavior in web surveys. In this study, we combined geospatial broadband data and the survey data of 16 waves of the mixed-mode GESIS Panel to investigate mode choice and panel attrition. Since small-scale geospatial data is often unavailable or difficult to access for research purposes, we report here results of a feasibility study investigating whether publicly available broadband data at the district level are sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions about participation behavior. In the first part of the analysis, we investigated the effects of broadband supply on mode choice. The results showed a positive effect of the broadband category with the highest coverage rate on choosing the online mode. We also found effects for internet familiarity, age, and education. In the second part, we investigated the effects of broadband supply on panel attrition within the 16 survey waves. We did not find significant effects of broadband supply on panel attrition. However, we found effects for evaluation of duration, measured duration, and age. Overall, we conclude that the granularity of the geospatial data on broadband supply is not ideal.

Lip service to liberal democracy in Western Europe?,"{Political scientists heavily rely on standard survey questions referring to “democracy” when they study citizens’ attitudes toward (liberal) democracy. However, we only know little about the way in which citizens respond to these questions. This article focuses on two frequently highlighted issues: social desirability and the consistency between citizens’ understanding and researchers’ understanding of the term “democracy.” To address these issues, I collected novel survey data via YouGov from 14,000 British, French, German, and Italian respondents. I use a list experiment to show that respondents do not feel socially pressured to misreport their support for democracy. However, what citizens have in mind when they claim to support democracy only reflects norms and institutions of minimal conceptions of democracy. Overall, this encourages the usage of questions regarding citizens’ support for democracy widely, although this should not be interpreted as the support for anything going beyond minimal conceptions of democracy (providing freedom and allowing for citizens’ influence on political decisions).}",2024,European Political Science Review,"{liberal democracy,list experiment,support for democracy,topic models,understandings of democracy}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.09848845745009872
Large language models as a substitute for human experts in annotating political text,"{Large-scale text analysis has grown rapidly as a method in political science and beyond. To date, text-as-data methods rely on large volumes of human-annotated training examples, which place a premium on researcher resources. However, advances in large language models (LLMs) may make automated annotation increasingly viable. This paper tests the performance of GPT-4 across a range of scenarios relevant for analysis of political text. We compare GPT-4 coding with human expert coding of tweets and news articles across four variables (whether text is political, its negativity, its sentiment, and its ideology) and across four countries (the United States, Chile, Germany, and Italy). GPT-4 coding is highly accurate, especially for shorter texts such as tweets, correctly classifying texts up to 95% of the time. Performance drops for longer news articles, and very slightly for non-English text. We introduce a ‘hybrid’ coding approach, in which disagreements of multiple GPT-4 runs are adjudicated by a human expert, which boosts accuracy. Finally, we explore downstream effects, finding that transformer models trained on hand-coded or GPT-4-coded data yield almost identical outcomes. Our results suggest that LLM-assisted coding is a viable and cost-efficient approach, although consideration should be given to task complexity.}",2024,Research and Politics,"{gpt,large language models,machine learning,text analysis,text-as-data}",Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
The Role of Intersectionality and Context in Measuring Gender-Based Violence in Universities and Research-Performing Organizations in Europe for the Development of Inclusive Structural Interventions,"{The aim of the article is to discuss how thinking about gender-based violence intersectionally and in context can not only enrich our understanding but also lead to transformative change in organizations. The article argues that to better understand gender-based violence in universities and research institutions, analyses need to be intersectional and contextual. Such approaches go beyond binary understandings of gender and narrow legalistic definitions of gender-based violence. The article reflects on how to operationalize this to derive starting points for intersectional categories to consider and contextual factors to measure at micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. It concludes that a multilevel intersectional analysis leads to more nuanced knowledge on experiences of gender-based violence and is, therefore, better equipped to inform the development of measures to eradicate the problem in an inclusive way.}",2024,Violence Against Women,"{gender-based violence,intersectionality,research-performing organizations,surveys,theorizing quantitative measurement}",Social Sciences,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",1.0

The (fe-)male breadwinner? Beliefs about gender roles in East Germany: An age-period-cohort analysis,"{Background: Beliefs about gender roles develop in a complex interplay of individual factors with the sociopolitical and historical context. They differ between birth cohorts, depend on individual age, and change over time. In recent years, a certain retraditionalization was observed, especially in younger East German birth cohorts. This study investigates whether younger cohorts indeed show more traditional beliefs when considering age and period effects as well as sociodemographic factors. Methods: Using data from seven cross sections (1992 to 2016) of an East German sample of the German General Social Survey (N = 5,426), hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) analyses were applied to simultaneously estimate the effects of age, birth cohort, and time period on gender role beliefs. Results: Significant cohort effects were observed, with those cohorts born and raised in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) showing the most egalitarian views. Similar to the oldest cohorts, the youngest cohorts exhibited more traditional beliefs. Conclusion: The results indeed suggest a trend toward retraditionalization of the gender role beliefs in the generations born after the end of the GDR compared to those born during its existence. Implications as well as limitations of the HAPC method are critically discussed.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
The Austrian Political Advertisement Scandal: Patterns of “Journalism for Sale”,"{Mounting concern surrounds the influence of political actors on journalism, especially as media outlets face increasing financial pressures. These circumstances can give rise to instances of media capture, a mutually corrupting relationship between political actors and media organizations. However, empirical evidence substantiating such mechanisms and their consequences remains limited, particularly in the context of Western democracies. This chapter investigates a recent case in which a former Austrian chancellor allegedly colluded with a tabloid newspaper to receive better news coverage in exchange for increased ad placements by government institutions. We employ automated content analysis to investigate political news articles from seventeen prominent Austrian news outlets spanning 2012–2021 (n = 222,659). Adopting a difference-in-differences approach, we find a substantial increase in media visibility of the former Austrian chancellor within the news outlet that is alleged to have received bribes, as well as a decrease in favorability for challenger candidates. Although this study does not aim to prove or disprove the involvement of specific political actors or media organizations in unethical or illegal activities, it introduces an innovative method for detecting unusual patterns in media reporting. Findings are discussed in the context of current threats to media independence and underscore the crucial need to protect journalistic integrity and ensure unbiased information for the public.}",2024,International Journal of Press/Politics,"{bribes,computational text analysis,difference-in-differences,media capture,media corruption,media independence}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",1.0
Do social engagement skills exist and matter beyond personality facet traits and vocational interests? A generalization study across six countries,"{Social engagement skills as capacities for active interpersonal engagement are thought to conceptually differ from behavioral and motivational tendencies and to predict learning and life outcomes. We tested these assumptions on the distinct nature and relevance of social engagement skills. Quota-representative self-reports from 6987 adults in six countries showed strong relations of social engagement skills with personality facets and weaker with vocational interests. Partially supporting their distinctiveness, social engagement skills were not fully reducible to those correlates. Skills predicted self-reported learning, quality-of-life, and job outcomes, but offered little incremental validity beyond personality and interests. Results largely generalized across countries. Yet, the complex interplay between social engagement skills, individual differences, and outcomes demonstrated cross-country variations, suggesting sensitivity to sociocontextual factors. We conclude that while social engagement skills conceptually differ from personality and interests and in themselves predict life success, they add limited empirical value beyond these constructs, at least for self-reports. Educational relevance statement: Social engagement skills are the capacities to actively engage with others. It is thought that these capacities differ from other person characteristics (e.g., behavioral or motivational tendencies), and that this distinction matters for explaining life success. Our study showed that while self-reported social engagement skills shared similarities with other person characteristics, they still had unique aspects. Moreover, social engagement skills mattered, such that more skilled adults reported higher quality-of-life, but not necessarily better learning. However, social engagement skills did not provide much extra insight into life success beyond what was already known from other person characteristics. Other than the remaining results, these complex relations between social engagement skills, person characteristics, and life success largely varied across countries. The results highlight the importance of assessing social skills in a situation-specific manner, which will be imperative for targeted educational practices in the future. Moreover, our study focused on adults, limiting applicability to youth, but results suggest that intervention efforts targeting social engagement skills may probably yield more interpersonal than academic benefits. Finally, when designing or adapting complex educational programs, practitioners should consider sociocontextual factors.}",2024,Learning and Individual Differences,"{cross-national data,individual differences,learning,life outcomes,social-emotional skills}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Careless whisper: Political elite discourses activate national identities for far-right voting preferences,"{While exclusionary national identities are widespread among Europeans, relatively few people vote for the far right in most countries. Thus, an exclusionary identity in many cases does not lead to voting for the most nativist types of parties. We explain this empirical puzzle by showing that these identities need to be activated to become behaviourally relevant. To this end, we analyse longitudinal comparative data of over 135,000 individuals across more than 26 years and 26 countries combining different survey programmes and manifesto data. We use latent class analysis to show that over half of respondents hold exclusionary conceptions of nationhood. Moreover, this type of national identity predicts voting far right. Using multi-level modelling and within-country estimators, we further demonstrate that this relationship is significantly stronger when a country's political elites across all parties become more exclusionary. Taking the activation hypothesis to the test in a European context, we conclude that the effect of national identity is conditional on its prior activation.}",2024,Nations and Nationalism,"{elite discourses,far right,longitudinal analysis,national identity,voting behaviour}",Arts and Humanities,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",1.0

Predicting bloc support in Irish general elections 1951–2020: A political history model,"{Election forecasting is a growing enterprise. Structural models relying on “fundamental” political and economic variables, principally to predict government performance, are popular in political science. Conventional wisdom though is these standard structural models fall short in predicting individual blocs’ performance and their applicability to multiparty systems is restricted. We challenge this by providing a structural forecast of bloc performance in Ireland, a case primarily overlooked in the election forecasting literature. Our model spurns the economic and performance variables conventionally associated with structural forecasting enterprises and instead concentrates on Ireland’s historical party and governance dynamics in the vein of testing whether these patterns alone offer solid predictions of election outcomes. Using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR), our approach, comprising measures of incumbency, short-term party support, and political and economic shocks, offers reasonable predictions of the vote share performance of four blocs: Ireland's two major parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, Independents, and the Left bloc combined across 20 elections spanning 60 years.}",2024,"Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties","{forecasting,ireland,parties,political history,structural models}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.14143053628433397
Toeing the Party Line: Election Manifestos as a Key to Understand Political Discourse on Twitter,"{Political discourse on Twitter is a moving target: politicians continuously make statements about their positions. It is therefore crucial to track their discourse on social media to understand their ideological positions and goals. However, Twitter data is also challenging to work with since it is ambiguous and often dependent on social context, and consequently, recent work on political positioning has tended to focus strongly on manifestos (parties' electoral programs) rather than social media. In this paper, we extend recently proposed methods to predict pairwise positional similarities between parties from the manifesto case to the Twitter case, using hashtags as a signal to fine-tune text representations, without the need for manual annotation. We verify the efficacy of fine-tuning and conduct a series of experiments that assess the robustness of our method for low-resource scenarios. We find that our method yields stable positioning reflective of manifesto positioning, both in scenarios with all tweets of candidates across years available and when only smaller subsets from shorter time periods are available. This indicates that it is possible to reliably analyze the relative positioning of actors forgoing manual annotation, even in the noisier context of social media.}",2024,"EMNLP 2024 - 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Findings of EMNLP 2024",,Computer Science,SS,26,"discourse, social media, polarization, scenarios, election",1.0

In this study, we compare measurement quality in an experiment of three distinct survey designs implemented in the German sample of the European Values Study: a single-mode face-to-face design, a mixed-mode mail/web design, and a shorter (matrix) questionnaire in the mixed-mode design. We compare measurement quality in different ways, including differences in distributions across several data quality indicators as well as equivalence testing over 140 items in 25 attitudinal scales. We find similar data quality across the survey designs, although the mixed-mode survey shows more item nonresponse compared to the single-mode survey. Using equivalence testing we find that most scales achieve metric equivalence and, to a lesser extent, scalar equivalence across the designs.}",2024,Sociological Methods and Research,"{data quality,matrix sampling,measurement invariance,mixed-mode survey,split questionnaire}",Social Sciences,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",0.0354014989337594
Developing a synthetic news corpus to validate generic frame detection methods,"{Frames are a central concept in communication research. Based on our literature review, we propose that frame identification is an act of identifying selected reality and communicative intention. We then highlight the conceptual and methodological issues of frame identification using computational methods. To avoid the correlation between topics and frames, we provide a synthetic dataset for evaluating frames found in multi-topical news content, using the detection of generic frames as a test case. With this dataset, for the first time, we benchmark manual coding and various automatic and semisupervised methods. Based on the preliminary benchmark results, this study provides evidence that generic frame identification using both manual coding and automatic methods might not be accurate.}",2024,Studies in Communication and Media,,Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",0.09193217657852618
Non-News Websites Expose People to More Political Content Than News Websites: Evidence from Browsing Data in Three Countries,"{Most scholars focus on the prevalence and democratic effects of (partisan) news exposure. This focus misses large parts of online activities of a majority of politically disinterested citizens. Although political content also appears outside of news outlets and may profoundly shape public opinion, its prevalence and effects are under-studied at scale. This project combines three-wave panel survey data from three countries (total N = 7,266) with online behavioral data from the same participants (over 106M visits). We create a multi-lingual classifier to identify political content both in news and outside (e.g. in shopping or entertainment sites). We find that news consumption is infrequent: just 3.4% of participants’ online browsing comprised visits to news sites. Only between 14% (NL) and 36% (US) of these visits were to news about politics. The overwhelming majority of participants' visits were to non-news sites. Although only 1.6\% of those visits related to politics, in absolute terms, citizens encounter politics more frequently outside of news than within news. Out of every 10 visits to political content, 3.4 come from news and 6.6 from non-news sites. Furthermore, exposure to political content outside news domains had the same–and in some cases stronger - associations with key democratic attitudes and behaviors as news exposure.

What makes computational communication science (ir)reproducible?,"{Computational methods are in full swing in communication science. Part of their promise is to make communication research more reproducible. However, how this plays out in practice has not been systematically studied. We verify the reproducibility of the entire cohort of 30 substantive and methods papers published in the journal Computational Communication Research (CCR), the official journal of the ICA Computational Methods Division with a focus on transparency and hence a high rate of voluntary Open Science participation in the field. Among these CCR papers, we are not able to verify the computational reproducibility of 16 papers as no data and/or code were shared. For the remaining 14 papers, we attempt to execute the code shared by the original authors in a standardized containerized computational environment. We encounter a variety of issues that preclude us from reproducing the original findings, where incomplete sharing of data or code is the most common issue. In the end, we could at least partially reproduce the findings in only 6 papers (20%). Based on our findings, we discuss strategies for researchers and the subfield to correct for this disheartening state of computational reproducibility.}",2024,Computational Communication Research,"{computational communication science,open science,reproducibility}",Social Sciences,SS,20,"open science, social media, publications, training, retrieval",1.0
Consistency of the Structural Properties of the BFI-10 Across 16 Samples from Eight Large-Scale Surveys in Germany,"{The assessment of the Big Five personality domains is standard practice in most large-scale social surveys nowadays. The instrument most widely used for this purpose is the BFI-10, an ultra-short measure assessing each Big Five domain with two items. Recent studies have identified issues with the structural properties of the BFI-10, especially its factorial validity. To investigate whether these issues arise from the instrument itself or biases due to translation or sampling, we examined the extent to which the structural properties of the BFI-10 in terms of descriptive statistics, intercorrelations, reliability, and factorial validity vary when keeping the target population and language constant. Results revealed that, across 16 independent samples (total N _ 60,000) from eight large-scale surveys representative of the adult population in Germany, the structural properties of the BFI-10 were (a) largely consistent and (b) mostly adequate. Most importantly, in nearly all samples, patterns of loading were congruent with an idealized Big Five structure, thereby supporting factorial validity. These results demonstrate that the structural properties of the BFI-10 are highly stable and replicable in large-scale samples. Especially given its brevity, the BFI-10 can thus be regarded as adequate for use in large-scale survey settings.}",2024,European Journal of Psychological Assessment,"{bfi-10,big five,factorial validity,large-scale surveys,psychometric properties}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.6105511765393187
"Pancultural Nostalgia in Action: Prevalence, Triggers, and Psychological Functions of Nostalgia Across Cultures","{Nostalgia is a social, self-relevant, and bittersweet (although mostly positive) emotion that arises when reflecting on fond past memories and serves key psychological functions. The majority of evidence concerning the prevalence, triggers, and functions of nostalgia has been amassed in samples from a handful of largely Western cultures. If nostalgia is a fundamental psychological resource, it should perform similar functions across cultures, although its operational dynamics may be shaped by culture. This study (N = 2,606) examined dispositional nostalgia, self-reported triggers of nostalgia, and functions of experimentally induced nostalgia in young adults across 28 countries and a special administrative region of China (i.e., Hong Kong). Results indicated that nostalgia is frequently experienced across cultures, albeit better valued in more-developed countries (i.e., higher national wealth and life-expectancy). Nostalgia is triggered by psychological threats (especially in warmer countries), sensory stimuli (especially in more-developed countries), and social gatherings (especially in less-developed countries). The positive or negative affect prompted by experimentally induced nostalgia varied by country, but was mild overall. More importantly, recalling a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) memory increased social connectedness, self-continuity, and meaning in life across cultures. In less-developed countries, recalling an ordinary memory also conferred some of these functions, reducing the effect size of nostalgia. Finally, recalling a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) memory augmented state satisfaction with life in countries with lower quality of living (i.e., lower life-expectancy and life-satisfaction). Overall, findings confirm the relevance of nostalgia across a wide range of cultures and indicate cultural nuances in its functioning.}",2024,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,"{culture,emotion,memory,nostalgia,well-being}",Psychology,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.7315072900300945
Investigating respondents’ willingness to participate in video-based web surveys,"{Recent developments in communication technology and changes in people’s communication habits facilitate new data collection forms in web surveys. Technical devices, such as computers, tablets, and smartphones, enable researchers to rethink established communication forms and add a human touch to web surveys. Designing web surveys more human-like has the great potential to make communication between researchers and respondents more natural, which may result in higher survey satisfaction and data quality. Considering the existing survey literature, there are only a few studies investigating respondents’ willingness for new communication forms in web surveys. Hence, in the present study, we explore respondents’ willingness to take part in web surveys to have interviewers read questions via pre-recorded videos (question delivery) and in which respondents provide their answers orally via self-recorded videos (question answering). We included two willingness questions – one on question delivery via pre-recorded videos and one on question answering via self-recorded videos – in the non-probability SoSci panel in Germany. The results reveal that respondents’ willingness to have questions read by interviewers is higher than their willingness to self-record video answers. Believing that technology facilitates communication and perceiving the survey as being interesting increases willingness, whereas evaluating the survey topic as sensitive decreases willingness. Personality traits do not play a role when it comes to respondents’ willingness, except for extraversion.}",2024,International Journal of Market Research,"{automatic question reading,non-probability panel,respondent willingness,self-recording answers,survey devices,web surveys}","Business, Management and Accounting",SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.014365617107083777
How does broadband supply affect participation in panel surveys?: Using geospatial broadband data at the district level to analyze mode choice and panel attrition,"{Good broadband supply is crucial for different aspects of participation behavior in web surveys. In this study, we combined geospatial broadband data and the survey data of 16 waves of the mixed-mode GESIS Panel to investigate mode choice and panel attrition. Since small-scale geospatial data is often unavailable or difficult to access for research purposes, we report here results of a feasibility study investigating whether publicly available broadband data at the district level are sufficient to draw meaningful conclusions about participation behavior. In the first part of the analysis, we investigated the effects of broadband supply on mode choice. The results showed a positive effect of the broadband category with the highest coverage rate on choosing the online mode. We also found effects for internet familiarity, age, and education. In the second part, we investigated the effects of broadband supply on panel attrition within the 16 survey waves. We did not find significant effects of broadband supply on panel attrition. However, we found effects for evaluation of duration, measured duration, and age. Overall, we conclude that the granularity of the geospatial data on broadband supply is not ideal.

"Black–Blue or Bahamas? Explaining CDU, CSU, FDP and AfD Voter Attitudes Towards a Common Governmental Coalition Before the 2017 German Federal Election","{Will the Alternative for Germany (AfD) soon be actively involved in forming Germany’s governments? The findings of this article illustrate that the established German parties would be well advised not to form a coalition involving the AfD as their own voters strongly oppose it. For the first time, coalition preferences for a so-called Black–Blue coalition (CDU, CSU and AfD) as well as a Bahamas coalition (CDU, CSU, FDP and AfD) are examined. Using regression models to explain the emergence of preferences for such coalitions, the findings indicate the following: (1) while an identification with the AfD leads to a higher desirability for such coalitions, the opposite is the case if an individual identifies with the CDU; (2) a positive impression of the AfD’s candidates leads to a stronger coalition preference, whereas the rejection of the CDU’s then chancellor-candidate Angela Merkel has no significant effect; and (3) opposing migration leads to a stronger preference for such coalitions.}",2024,German Politics,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.96672567882712

Asking for Traces: A Vignette Study on Acceptability Norms and Personal Willingness to Donate Digital Trace Data,"{Digital trace data are increasingly used in the social sciences. Given the risks associated with data access via application programming interfaces (APIs) as well as ethical discussions around the use of such data, data donations have been proposed as a methodologically reliable and ethically sound way of collecting digital trace data. While data donations have many advantages, study participants may be reluctant to share their data, for example, due to privacy concerns. To assess which factors in a data donation request are relevant for participants’ acceptance and decisions, we conducted a vignette experiment investigating the general acceptability and personal willingness to donate various data types (i.e., data from GPS, web browsing, LinkedIn/Xing, Facebook, and TikTok) for research purposes. The preregistered study was implemented in the probability-based German Internet Panel (GIP) and gathered responses from n = 3821 participants. Results show that people rate the general acceptability of data donation requests higher than their own willingness to donate data. Regarding the different data types, respondents indicated that they would be more willing to donate their LinkedIn/Xing, TikTok, and GPS data compared to web browsing and Facebook data. In contrast, information about whether the donated data would be shared with other researchers and data security did not affect the responses to the respective donation scenarios.

Do social engagement skills exist and matter beyond personality facet traits and vocational interests? A generalization study across six countries,"{Social engagement skills as capacities for active interpersonal engagement are thought to conceptually differ from behavioral and motivational tendencies and to predict learning and life outcomes. We tested these assumptions on the distinct nature and relevance of social engagement skills. Quota-representative self-reports from 6987 adults in six countries showed strong relations of social engagement skills with personality facets and weaker with vocational interests. Partially supporting their distinctiveness, social engagement skills were not fully reducible to those correlates. Skills predicted self-reported learning, quality-of-life, and job outcomes, but offered little incremental validity beyond personality and interests. Results largely generalized across countries. Yet, the complex interplay between social engagement skills, individual differences, and outcomes demonstrated cross-country variations, suggesting sensitivity to sociocontextual factors. We conclude that while social engagement skills conceptually differ from personality and interests and in themselves predict life success, they add limited empirical value beyond these constructs, at least for self-reports. Educational relevance statement: Social engagement skills are the capacities to actively engage with others. It is thought that these capacities differ from other person characteristics (e.g., behavioral or motivational tendencies), and that this distinction matters for explaining life success. Our study showed that while self-reported social engagement skills shared similarities with other person characteristics, they still had unique aspects. Moreover, social engagement skills mattered, such that more skilled adults reported higher quality-of-life, but not necessarily better learning. However, social engagement skills did not provide much extra insight into life success beyond what was already known from other person characteristics. Other than the remaining results, these complex relations between social engagement skills, person characteristics, and life success largely varied across countries. The results highlight the importance of assessing social skills in a situation-specific manner, which will be imperative for targeted educational practices in the future. Moreover, our study focused on adults, limiting applicability to youth, but results suggest that intervention efforts targeting social engagement skills may probably yield more interpersonal than academic benefits. Finally, when designing or adapting complex educational programs, practitioners should consider sociocontextual factors.}",2024,Learning and Individual Differences,"{cross-national data,individual differences,learning,life outcomes,social-emotional skills}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.9310875771434137

Is the migrant share really the problem?

As predictors, we looked at outgroup size, gross domestic product, and unemployment rate on a county level. On the individual level, we included authoritarianism and a wide range of sociodemographic variables. Individual authoritarianism was identified as the strongest predictor of xenophobic attitudes. On the county level, a higher proportion of migrants was associated with lower values of xenophobia. This serves as an indicator for contact hypothesis. Our results suggest that contextualizing social psychological and micro-sociological theories and employing multilevel analyses are valuable tools to detangle the interplay of individual and contextual influences on xenophobic attitudes.}",2024,Ethnic and Racial Studies,"{authoritarianism,county level,east/west germany,migrant share,multilevel model,xenophobia}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.3966134246014861

Argument Quality Assessment in the Age of Instruction-Following Large Language Models,"{The computational treatment of arguments on controversial issues has been subject to extensive NLP research, due to its envisioned impact on opinion formation, decision making, writing education, and the like.

We argue that the capabilities of instruction-following large language models (LLMs) to leverage knowledge across contexts enable a much more reliable assessment. Rather than just fine-tuning LLMs towards leaderboard chasing on assessment tasks, they need to be instructed systematically with argumentation theories and scenarios as well as with ways to solve argument-related problems.

Careless whisper: Political elite discourses activate national identities for far-right voting preferences,"{While exclusionary national identities are widespread among Europeans, relatively few people vote for the far right in most countries. Thus, an exclusionary identity in many cases does not lead to voting for the most nativist types of parties. We explain this empirical puzzle by showing that these identities need to be activated to become behaviourally relevant. To this end, we analyse longitudinal comparative data of over 135,000 individuals across more than 26 years and 26 countries combining different survey programmes and manifesto data. We use latent class analysis to show that over half of respondents hold exclusionary conceptions of nationhood. Moreover, this type of national identity predicts voting far right. Using multi-level modelling and within-country estimators, we further demonstrate that this relationship is significantly stronger when a country's political elites across all parties become more exclusionary. Taking the activation hypothesis to the test in a European context, we conclude that the effect of national identity is conditional on its prior activation.}",2024,Nations and Nationalism,"{elite discourses,far right,longitudinal analysis,national identity,voting behaviour}",Social Sciences,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",1.0
Panel Conditioning in A Probability-based Longitudinal study: A Comparison of Respondents with Different Levels of Survey Experience,"{Learning effects due to repeated interviewing, also known as panel conditioning, are a major threat to response quality in later waves of a panel study. To date, research has not provided a clear picture regarding the circumstances, mechanisms, and dimensions of potential panel conditioning effects. In particular, the effects of conditioning frequency, that is, different levels of experience within a panel, on response quality are underexplored. Against this background, we investigated the effects of panel conditioning by using data from the GESIS Panel, a German mixed-mode probability-based panel study. Using two refreshment samples, we compared three panel cohorts with differing levels of experience on several response quality indicators related to the mechanisms of reflection, satisficing, and social desirability. Overall, we find evidence for both negative (i.e., disadvantageous for response quality) and positive (i.e., advantageous for response quality) panel conditioning. Highly experienced respondents were more likely to satisfice by speeding through the questionnaire. They also had a higher probability of refusing to answer sensitive questions than less experienced panel members. However, more experienced respondents were also more likely to optimize the response process by needing less time compared to panelists with lower experience levels (when controlling for speeding). In contrast, we did not find significant differences with respect to the number of ""don't know""responses, nondifferentiation, the selection of first response categories and mid-responses, and the number of nontriggered filter questions. Of the observed differences, speeding showed the highest magnitude with an average increase of 6.0 percentage points for highly experienced panel members compared to low experienced panelists.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{data quality,longitudinal surveys,panel conditioning,probability-based panel study}",Social Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",1.0

Results:: In each study, pollsters obtained significantly more negative ratings when compared to “survey researchers” and “public opinion researchers,” suggesting that the general public views pollsters, who are more likely to be viewed as partisan, as being less honest/ethical. In line with social identity theory, interaction models revealed that those rating pollster critic Donald Trump most favorably had the most negative ratings of pollsters and public opinion researchers, compared to survey researchers.

Lip service to liberal democracy in Western Europe?,"{Political scientists heavily rely on standard survey questions referring to “democracy” when they study citizens’ attitudes toward (liberal) democracy. However, we only know little about the way in which citizens respond to these questions.

I use a list experiment to show that respondents do not feel socially pressured to misreport their support for democracy. However, what citizens have in mind when they claim to support democracy only reflects norms and institutions of minimal conceptions of democracy.

United in disagreement: Analyzing policy networks in EU policy making,"{Shared belief systems are generally assumed to forge policy networks. Empirical evidence whether and to what extend shared policy core beliefs create ally networks and under which circumstances shared policy core beliefs are not necessary to form these networks, however, is limited. Based on a novel inferential network approach in combination with mediation analysis, this study investigates the role of belief systems as a link between interest group type and policy preference congruence, ultimately leading to ally networks in the European Union. In order to measure the intervening effect of policy core beliefs, automated text analysis is used. Our results suggest that shared policy core beliefs are a strong mediator for members of the same interest group. In addition, “strange bedfellow” networks between NGOs and businesses do, in fact, lack belief congruence and emerge on issues with low potential for intergroup conflict. This paper makes a contribution to our understanding of ally network formation and adds to the emerging line of research which combines quantitative text with inferential network analysis.}",2024,Review of Policy Research,"{advocacy coalitions,automated text analysis,eu energy policy,inferential network analysis,interest groups}",Environmental Science,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.025840846903540278
Survey experience and its positive impact on response behavior in longitudinal surveys: Evidence from the probability-based GESIS Panel,"{Across waves of a panel survey, panel members are repeatedly exposed to the same or very similar survey questions, which might lead to learning effects. We used data from 24 waves of online interviews in a probability-based panel survey to investigate the positive and negative effects of becoming more familiar with the survey questions. We found that respondents became increasingly faster when answering the same questions across waves. Our analyses revealed that this effect could be attributed only partly to satisficing response behaviors associated with negative learning effects (i.e. speeding). In fact, positive learning effects (i.e. answering faster because of greater familiarity with the response tasks) appear to be the primary driver of change in response times. In summary, our research suggests that learning across waves of a panel survey has a positive effect on response behavior, which researchers should consider in survey planning and operations.}",2024,International Journal of Social Research Methodology,"{data quality,learning effects,measurement error,panel conditioning,panel surveys,survey experience}",,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.07927938228621621
"Black–Blue or Bahamas? Explaining CDU, CSU, FDP and AfD Voter Attitudes Towards a Common Governmental Coalition Before the 2017 German Federal Election","{Will the Alternative for Germany (AfD) soon be actively involved in forming Germany’s governments? The findings of this article illustrate that the established German parties would be well advised not to form a coalition involving the AfD as their own voters strongly oppose it. For the first time, coalition preferences for a so-called Black–Blue coalition (CDU, CSU and AfD) as well as a Bahamas coalition (CDU, CSU, FDP and AfD) are examined. Using regression models to explain the emergence of preferences for such coalitions, the findings indicate the following: (1) while an identification with the AfD leads to a higher desirability for such coalitions, the opposite is the case if an individual identifies with the CDU; (2) a positive impression of the AfD’s candidates leads to a stronger coalition preference, whereas the rejection of the CDU’s then chancellor-candidate Angela Merkel has no significant effect; and (3) opposing migration leads to a stronger preference for such coalitions.}",2024,German Politics,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Stamp—Standardized Data Management Plan for Educational Research: A Blueprint to Improve Data Management across Disciplines,"{To provide more tailored, discipline-specific guidance on data management, Science Europe suggested the concept of domain data protocols. Based on this concept, the project Domain Data Protocols for Educational Research developed a first domain data protocol for educational research, titled Standardized Data Management Plan for Educational Research (Stamp). Its multi-level approach includes minimal conditions on managing data according to the FAIR Data Principles and checklists with concrete activities to reach each minimal condition; also included are auxiliary materials to support researchers in educational research in planning, implementing, and realizing different data management activities. Although we developed the Stamp for educational research, its design and flexible structure enables transferring it to other (research) domains and communities. To investigate this flexibility, we organized two workshops, discussing to what extent the Stamp can be used beyond educational research, with representatives from other social science domains as well as from research domains beyond the social sciences. In sum, there was consensus among participants of both workshops on the usability of the Stamp outside educational research, at least if the same types of data are processed and analyzed with similar methods. For other types of data, the Stamp serves as a blueprint to develop further domain data protocols, in terms of standardized data management plans, according to the specific needs of the respective domain.}",2024,Data Science Journal,"{(research) data management,cross-disciplinary data management,data management plans,discipline-specific guidance,domain data protocols,standardization}",Computer Science,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
"Religion, spirituality, and susceptibility to conspiracy theories: Examining the role of analytic thinking and post-critical beliefs","{The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the political and scholarly attention on conspiracy theories. Among other predictors, religious and spiritual influences on conspiracy beliefs have been widely discussed in the literature. We suggest analyzing the relationship between religion and spirituality on the one hand and conspiracy beliefs on the other hand from the perspective of religious information processing. Based on the Post-Critical Beliefs Scale (PCBS), we argue that literal interpretations of religious information are positively associated with conspiracy beliefs. Furthermore, we assume that individual differences in analytic cognitive style account for the relationship between religious attitudes, spirituality, and conspiracism. Using a quota sample of German adults, we find that literal interpretations of religious content positively correlate with conspiracy beliefs for the literal affirmation of transcendence (e.g., orthodoxy) and the literal disaffirmation of transcendence (e.g., atheism). These findings suggest that religious information processing is related to conspiracy beliefs for religious and nonreligious individuals. Moreover, our results show a stable association between holistic spirituality and conspiracy beliefs. The relationships between different types of religious attitudes, spirituality, and conspiracy beliefs hold, even after accounting for analytic (versus intuitive) thinking. The implications for the study of religious attitudes and conspiracy beliefs are discussed.}",2024,Politics and Religion,"{analytic cognitive style,conspiracy beliefs,conspiracy mentality,holistic spirituality,post-critical beliefs}",Arts and Humanities,SS,10,"covid 19 pandemic, trust, actor, social science, hybrid",0.14031508411286026

Equipping the Offline Population with Internet Access in an Online Panel: Does It Make a Difference?,"{Online panel surveys are often criticized for their inability to cover the offline population, potentially resulting in coverage error. Previous research has demonstrated that non-internet users in fact differ from online individuals on several sociodemographic characteristics. In attempts to reduce coverage error due to missing the offline population, several probability-based online panels equip offline households with an internet connection and a simple computer or tablet. However, the question remains whether the recruitment of offline individuals for an online panel leads to substantial changes in survey estimates. That is, it is unclear whether estimates derived from the survey data are affected by the differences between the groups of online and offline individuals. Against this background, we investigate how the inclusion of the previously offline population into the German Internet Panel affects various survey estimates such as voting behavior and social engagement.

Mainstreaming the populist radical right?

We contribute to this classic debate by analyzing the web browsing histories and survey responses of six thousand study participants in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK during the 2019 European Parliament election. Linking direct measures of online news exposure to voting behavior allows us to assess the effects of the salience of issues politicized by RRPPs on their electoral support. The likelihood to vote for RRPPs was higher when the EU was more salient in individual media diets, while exposure to the less salient issue of immigration did not increase the propensity to vote for RRPPs. Alongside consistent results for other party families and interactions with pre-existing voting intentions, the findings indicate that the electoral effects of online media are contingent on the overall salience of a specific issue and voters’ predispositions.}",2024,European Political Science Review,"{european parliament election,euroscepticism,immigration,media exposure,populist radical right,voting behavior}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.11015771804290202

A mixed-method approach, combining Facebook browser tracking data and a four-wave panel survey, was adopted during the 2021 Dutch General Election campaign. The results showed that the number of political ads received from a specific party has a positive effect on both the propensity and choice to vote for that party. In addition, people with less political knowledge and online privacy literacy are more likely to be persuaded by online political ads. However, at the party level, there is no evidence indicating that the effect of political ads on party preference is stronger for new parties than for established parties.

The ethnic penalty in welfare deservingness: A factorial survey experiment on welfare chauvinism in pension attitudes in Germany,"{This study investigates whether pensioners with a foreign ethnic background are perceived as less deserving to receive a pension than are native pensioners. It focuses on Germany as an example with a strongly achievement-oriented social insurance system which closely links benefits to previous contributions. Hence, the system prevents a citizen from receiving benefits without having contributed. Our study thus adds to existing research by examining a less likely case to find welfare chauvinistic attitudes. To test our expectations, we rely on a factorial survey design and a probability sample of the German population in 2019. Survey respondents decide on the amount of pension benefits that a hypothetical pensioner should receive. Characteristics of the hypothetical pensioner – ethnic background, gender, last income, contribution years, the number of children and other dependents – are randomly varied. Our study finds support for welfare chauvinist attitudes in an achievement-oriented social insurance system. Even for the same achievement, that is, same income, contribution years and number of children, natives grant lower pensions to pensioners with a foreign ethnic background than to natives. Also, even if migrants show the most favourable behaviour (that is, having contributed to the pension system for many years and with a high income), the ethnic penalty in pensions remains significant.}",2024,Journal of European Social Policy,"{deservingness,factorial survey experiment,pensions,welfare chauvinism}",,SS,23,"european, governance, crises, attitudes, levels",1.0
Uncovering latent profiles of ICT self-concept among adults in Germany and their relation with gender,"{Self-concept related to the use of information and communication technology (ICT-SC) is reflected in how people feel and behave when confronted with digital technologies. Although evidence from variable-centered analyses suggests a hierarchical and multidimensional structure of ICT-SC in heterogeneous populations, it is not yet known whether different profiles of general ICT-SC and specific ICT-SC domains (communicate, process and store, generate content, safe application, solve problems) exist. This study aims to extend previous research using person-centered analyses and to examine whether different profiles of ICT-SC can be identified in a heterogeneous adult population (18–69 years) from Germany and how these profiles relate to gender. Results of a latent profile analysis (German quota sample, N = 369) indicate a reliable three-profile solution. Profile I (n = 48) is characterised by rather low ICT-SC with relative profile strengths in the verbal-interactive domains (communicate, process and store). Profile II (n = 149) is characterised by low to average ICT-SC across ICT-SC domains. Profile III (n = 172) is characterised by high ICT-SC with profile strengths in the technical-analytical domains (safe application, solve problems). Gender did not correlate significantly with profile membership. We discuss the practical implications of the results for ICT-SC interventions and suggest directions for future research.}",2024,Behaviour and Information Technology,"{digcomp,gender differences,ict competence,ict self-concept,latent profile analysis}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
"Incivility in Comparison: How Context, Content, and Personal Characteristics Predict Exposure to Uncivil Content","{Incivility, that is, the breaking of social norms of conversation, is evidently prevalent in online political communication. While a growing literature provides evidence on the prevalence of incivility in different online venues, it is still unclear where and to what extent Internet users are exposed to incivility. This paper takes a comparative approach to assess the levels of incivility across contexts, content and personal characteristics. The pre-registered analysis uses detailed web browsing histories, including public Facebook posts and tweets seen by study participants, in combination with surveys collected during the German federal election 2021 (N = 739). The level of incivility is predicted using Google’s Perspective API and compared across contexts (platforms and campaign periods), content features, and individual-level variables. The findings show that incivility is particularly strong on Twitter and more prevalent in comments than original posts/tweets on Facebook and Twitter. Content featuring political content and actors is more uncivil, whereas personal characteristics are less relevant predictors. The finding that user-generated political content is the most likely source of individuals’ exposure to incivility adds to the understanding of social media’s impact on public discourse.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,"{election campaigns,incivility,negativity,political information,social media,web browsing data}",Social Sciences,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",1.0

Messages that are sent by a party the respondent likes and deal with a political issue the respondent considers important are rated more acceptable. Furthermore, targeting based on general characteristics instead of individual ones is considered more acceptable, as is a general call to participate in the upcoming elections instead of a specific call to vote for a certain party. Effects differ across regulatory contexts, with the negative impact of both individual targeting and a specific call to vote for a certain party being in countries that have higher levels of legislative regulation.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,"{acceptance,cross-national comparison,data driven campaigns,data-driven campaigning,elections,microtargeting,privacy,privacy regulations,vignette study,vignettes}",Social Sciences,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",1.0

Methods: A population-representative survey (N = 2075, of which N = 163 were descendants of displaced persons) was used to determine the preponderance of suicidal ideation, depression and anxiety symptoms, and of suicide attempts over the lifespan. Results: A larger proportion of descendants of displaced persons (7.3 %) than the rest of the population (4%) reported suicide attempts. There were no such differences in anxiety, depression symptoms or suicidal ideation. Controlling for socio-demographic variables, parental experiences of displacement background remained associated with suicide attempts (OR=2.65, 95%CI 1.43-4.92).

Antisemitism in East and W est Germany: Three decades after the wall: a comparative longitudinal study considering age-period-cohort effects,"{Since the unification of the two German states in 1990, antisemitic attitudes have been repeatedly polled in cross-sectional or longitudinal national surveys (e.g., the long-term GFE surveys). So far, comparative studies analyzing the development of antisemitism in East and West Germany over a longer time period are scarce. The study covers a time span of 30 years to investigate two forms of antisemitism (classical and secondary), especially with respect to inner-German differences. Applying model-based age-period-cohort analyses (APC) with a total of 19 available representative surveys (maximal period: 1991-2021), theory-driven hypotheses are tested. The statistical approach and respective findings are discussed with emphasis on several challenges accompanying the utilized heterogenous data and different survey modes. Findings reveal that life-cycle effects play a decisive role in the attitudinal development and distribution of antisemitic attitudes. Moreover, approval of antisemitism is to some extent cohort related in both East and West Germany, while disentangling period effects empirically poses challenges due to data limitations. Furthermore, the observed APC structures differ for classical and secondary antisemitism.

Is there a geography of Euroscepticism among the winners and losers of globalization?,"{Support for EU membership has long been an important topic of study. Individual-level research shows that winners of globalisation, including the higher educated, express greater EU support as they profit from economic and cultural conditions resulting from European integration. Recent context-focused work suggests that individuals in ‘left-behind’ places are less supportive of EU integration because of their home regions’ weaker long-term economic conditions. This paper brings these two research strands into conversation with each other by examining how the relationship between EU support and individual-level education is contingent on subnational economic conditions. Using harmonised Eurobarometer data from almost 750,000 respondents spanning 2004–2019, combined with subnational economic data from 201 European regions, we find no evidence that subnational economic conditions influence the relationship between EU support and respondents’ education level. At the same time, when cross-sectionally comparing long-term differences between regions, we find that EU support is positively related to regional GDP per capita (though unrelated to regional unemployment), among both the higher and lower educated, and especially in the post-Great Recession period. Longitudinally, EU support is positively related to declining regional unemployment, both among the higher and lower educated, but not to increasing regional GDP per capita.}",2024,Journal of European Public Policy,"{education,euroscepticism,political geography,subnational economic conditions}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.05009760319570663
"Social Media, Misinformation, and Attitudes Towards Democracy in Germany During the Covid-19 Pandemic","{Social media platforms are a double-edged sword, serving as sources of both critical information and harmful misinformation. This duality has sparked debates about their potential role in threatening democracy, boosting radical parties, and amplifying authoritarian and populist attitudes. While much research has focused on how misinformation and social media usage can influence voting for radical and populist parties, research on how diffuse and specific support for democracy are affected by the level of misinformation is more scarce. This study examines how satisfaction with democracy, democratic legitimacy, and adherence to liberal democratic principles are shaped by social media usage and citizens’ susceptibility to misinformation. Employing novel data from an online survey conducted in Germany in June 2021, we show that political information sources and misinformation exposure have a greater impact on perceptions of democratic functioning than on support for democracy as a political ideal. Furthermore, for citizens prone to believing misinformation, media consumption habits have no significant impact highlighting a critical blind spot in addressing democracy’s resilience in the digital age.}",2024,German Politics,,Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",1.0

Previous studies have shown that individual affectedness leads to ‘exiting’, whereas in times of crisis grievances lead to increased political participation. What all these studies have in common is that they solely investigate actual deprivation. The present study adds a new aspect and examines if the individual risk perception of becoming deprived influences political participation. Does the individual risk perception of becoming deprived influence political participation and, if so, does this depend on the economic context? Based on grievance theory and using data from the European Social Survey and the World Bank, this study shows that the personal risk of becoming deprived increases the likelihood of participation. However, the participation-enhancing effect of one’s own risk perception is diminished when individuals live in an economically weak country and thus see no chance of improvement. This underlines that context plays a role and that economically deteriorating situations in the country can reduce participation rates.}",2024,Acta Politica,"{economic crisis,multi-level modelling,political participation,risk perception,status threat}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",1.0
Search engine effects on news consumption: Ranking and representativeness outweigh familiarity in news selection,"{While individuals’ trust in search engine results is well-supported, little is known about their preferences when selecting news. We use web-tracked behavioral data across a 2-month period (280 participants) and we analyze three competing factors, two algorithmic (ranking and representativeness) and one psychological (familiarity), that could influence the selection of search results. We use news engagement as a proxy for familiarity and investigate news articles presented on Google search pages (n = 1221). We find a significant effect of algorithmic factors but not of familiarity. We find that ranking plays a lesser role for news compared to non-news, suggesting a more careful decision-making process. We confirm that Google Search drives individuals to unfamiliar sources, and find that it increases the diversity of the political audience of news sources. We tackle the challenge of measuring social science theories in contexts shaped by algorithms, demonstrating their leverage over the behaviors of individuals.}",2024,New Media and Society,"{familiarity,news consumption,news diversity,search engines,web tracking}",Social Sciences,SS,24,"search engines, performance, open science, political science, 2021",1.0
Is the grass greener on the other side? Benchmarking Covid-19 vaccine procurement against the British experience,"{The Covid-19 pandemic placed responsibility on the European Union (EU) to effectively mitigate this common challenge. An important aspect of the common fight against the virus was the collective procurement of vaccines. The initially slow process of vaccine delivery may have caused overall frustration within societies and may also have had a profound effect on people's assessment of their country's EU membership. This paper examines this assumption via unique panel data collected in Germany in three waves between November 2020 and August 2021. We show that citizens evaluated their country's EU membership negatively especially when the EU's progress on vaccinations was in its early stages. In addition, public assessment was particularly negative when vaccination progress was compared to the situation in the United Kingdom (UK). Overall, our findings point to volatile levels of EU support depending on respondents' perceptions of the success of the UK outside the EU.}",2024,European Political Science Review,"{benchmark theory,brexit,covid-19,germany,vaccination}",Social Sciences,SS,25,"risk, children, immigration, 19 pandemic, 2020",1.0
Is the migrant share really the problem? Size of migrant population and individual authoritarianism as major determinants of xenophobic attitudes,"{Contact hypothesis and threat hypothesis are among the most influential theories of xenophobia. The former proposes that intergroup contact may reduce prejudice. The latter suggests that a large outgroup may increase xenophobic attitudes. Using data of a 2018 German representative sample (N = 2,016), we employed multilevel analyses. As predictors, we looked at outgroup size, gross domestic product, and unemployment rate on a county level. On the individual level, we included authoritarianism and a wide range of sociodemographic variables. Individual authoritarianism was identified as the strongest predictor of xenophobic attitudes. On the county level, a higher proportion of migrants was associated with lower values of xenophobia. This serves as an indicator for contact hypothesis. Our results suggest that contextualizing social psychological and micro-sociological theories and employing multilevel analyses are valuable tools to detangle the interplay of individual and contextual influences on xenophobic attitudes.}",2024,Ethnic and Racial Studies,"{authoritarianism,county level,east/west germany,migrant share,multilevel model,xenophobia}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.39709099298076117
Measuring the Four Higher-Order Values in Schwartz’s Theory: Validation of a 17-Item Inventory,"{Schwartz’s theory of basic human values is the dominant framework for assessing values. One of its strengths is that it allows for different levels of analysis. The 10 basic values can be reliably assigned to four higher-order dimensions: Openness to Change, Conservation, Self-Transcendence, and Self-Enhancement. In this paper, we examined the psychometric properties of the Higher-Order-Value Scale-17 (HOVS17), an inventory that economically assesses these higher-order values. We analyzed data from the GESIS Panel, an ongoing large-scale probability-based panel study that fields HOVS17 annually since 2013 and for which HOVS17 was originally developed. We found HOVS17 to have satisfactory psychometric properties. The 17 items were located in the two-dimensional multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) space as hypothesized. All four subscales were unidimensional, showed good fit when modeled as reflective latent variables, and had acceptable reliabilities as well as one-year test–retest stabilities (.65 to.69). The subscales correlated in theoretically plausible ways with a wide range of correlates and criteria, such as personality traits and well-being. This demonstrates that HOVS17 provides a sound basis for studying the development, precursors, and consequences of the higher-order values in the GESIS Panel and in future surveys that adopt HOVS17. We also discuss suggestions for further improvements of the inventory.}",2024,Journal of Personality Assessment,,Psychology,SS,14,"arguments, quality, mining, language model, artificial intelligence",0.4398119297298233
Fixed is not the opposite of growth: Item keying matters for measuring mindsets,"{Research on growth mindset, the belief that one’s cognitive abilities are malleable and can be developed through dedication and practice, has received considerable media attention and influenced educational policy and practice. However, mindset theory and measurement have also drawn criticism. In the present paper, we add a cautionary note pertaining to the conceptualization and measurement of growth mindset. Through a critical reanalysis of a large-scale representative study of adolescents from the US (N = 15,362), we show that a growth (i.e., forward-keyed) and a fixed (i.e., reverse keyed) mindset item from a widely used scale are only moderately correlated (r = −.31). Further, we demonstrate that the two items are very differently related with a range of educationally relevant criteria such as learning engagement and self-efficacy, and sociodemographic characteristics such as sex. This leads us to conclude that the growth and fixed mindset items are not mutually interchangeable (apart from keying) indicators of a unidimensional construct that has fixed and growth mindset at its opposing poles. Which items researchers choose to measure mindset (fixed, growth, or a blend thereof) may therefore have a significant impact on the findings they obtain. Our insights highlight the need for greater attention to the conceptual foundations and measurement of mindset in future studies.}",2024,Social Psychology of Education,"{acquiescence,dimensionality,fixed mindset,growth mindset,item keying,validity}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.18687184830129797
Are We Replicating Yet? Reproduction and Replication in Communication Research,"{The replication crisis has highlighted the importance of reproducibility and replicability in the social and behavioral sciences, including in communication research. While there have been some discussions of and studies on replications in communication research, the extent of this work is significantly lower than in psychology. The key reasons for this limitation are the differences between the disciplines in the topics commonly studied and in the methods and data commonly used in communication research. Communication research often investigates dynamic topics and uses methods (e.g., content analysis) and data types (e.g., media content and social media data) that are not used, or, at least, are much less frequently used, in other fields. These specific characteristics of communication research must be considered and require a more nuanced understanding of reproducibility and replicability. This thematic issue includes commentaries presenting different perspectives, as well as methodological and empirical work investigating the reproducibility and replicability of a wide range of communication research, including surveys, experiments, systematic literature reviews, and studies that involve social media or audio data.

INNOVATING WEB PROBING: COMPARING WRITTEN AND ORAL ANSWERS TO OPEN-ENDED PROBING QUESTIONS IN A SMARTPHONE SURVEY,"{Cognitive interviewing in the form of probing is key for developing methodologically sound survey questions. For a long time, probing was tied to the laboratory setting, making it difficult to achieve large sample sizes and creating a time-intensive undertaking for both researchers and participants. Web surveys paved the way for administering probing questions over the Internet in a time- and cost-efficient manner. In so-called web probing studies, respondents first answer a question and then they receive one or more open-ended questions about their response process, with requests for written answers. However, participants frequently provide very short or no answers at all to open-ended questions, in part because answering questions in writing is tedious. This is especially the case when the web survey is completed via a smartphone with a virtual on-screen keypad that shrinks the viewing space. In this study, we examine whether the problem of short and uninterpretable answers in web probing studies can be mitigated by asking respondents to complete the web survey on a smartphone and to record their answers via the built-in microphone. We conducted an experiment in a smartphone survey (N= 1,001), randomizing respondents to different communication modes (written or oral) for answering two comprehension probes about two questions on national identity and citizenship. The results indicate that probes with requests for oral answers produce four to five times more nonresponse than their written counterparts. However, oral answers contain about three times as many words, include about 0.3 more themes (first probing question only), and the proportion of clearly interpretable answers is about 6 percentage points higher (for the first probing question only). Nonetheless, both communication modes result in similar themes mentioned by respondents.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{cognitive pretesting,experiment,smartphone survey,survey question design,voice recording,web probing}",Social Sciences,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",0.4159317807708675
AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images,"{Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052 % were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.}",2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"{ai-generated content,fake image detection,social networks}",Computer Science,SS,21,"modeling, detection, correlation, gender, depth",1.0

We found that users overwhelmingly choose to target Social Media apps. We found that the short design frictions introduced by one sec effectively reduce how often users attempt to open target apps and lead to more intentional app-openings over time. Additionally, we found that users take periodic breaks from one sec interventions, and quickly rebound from a pattern of overuse when returning from breaks.

CooRTweet: A Generalized R Software for Coordinated Network Detection,"{This paper introduces CooRTweet, an innovative R package designed for detecting and analyzing coordinated behavior. CooRTweet’s distinctiveness lies in its essential architecture, derived from a minimal definition of coordinated behavior that captures its core elements in an abstract way. This approach makes it possible for the tool to be applied to the widest range of cases, from mono-modal network analysis on a single social media platform, to multi-modal and cross-platform network analysis, and to any types of objects shared by a network, whether singular identical objects (e.g., the same tweet), similar objects (e.g., clusters of similar images), or complex objects (e.g., a combination of hashtags, images, and emojis). Additionally, it offers a comprehensive view of coordinated activities that include both explicit coordination and organic forms of content sharing. The comprehensive architecture of CooRTweet provides flexibility and a broad scope for analyzing coordinated activities across various digital landscapes. This positions it as a distinctive resource for researchers investigating coordinated communication online. More generally, CooRTweet provides a valuable example to methodologists and research tool developers of how software tools for research can be developed in a generalized and thus flexible way. This is particularly important for social media research, given how quickly new APIs are being released, modified, and even shut down. This paper aims to provide an introduction to CooRTweet and the analysis of coordinated behavior, demonstrating the software’s application through a case study of cross-platform coordinated behavior during the 2021 German elections.}",2024,Polish Archaeology in the Mediterranean,"{coordinated behavior,information campaigns,network analysis,social media}",Arts and Humanities,SS,26,"discourse, social media, polarization, scenarios, election",1.0
Is there a geography of Euroscepticism among the winners and losers of globalization?,"{Support for EU membership has long been an important topic of study. Individual-level research shows that winners of globalisation, including the higher educated, express greater EU support as they profit from economic and cultural conditions resulting from European integration. Recent context-focused work suggests that individuals in ‘left-behind’ places are less supportive of EU integration because of their home regions’ weaker long-term economic conditions. This paper brings these two research strands into conversation with each other by examining how the relationship between EU support and individual-level education is contingent on subnational economic conditions. Using harmonised Eurobarometer data from almost 750,000 respondents spanning 2004–2019, combined with subnational economic data from 201 European regions, we find no evidence that subnational economic conditions influence the relationship between EU support and respondents’ education level. At the same time, when cross-sectionally comparing long-term differences between regions, we find that EU support is positively related to regional GDP per capita (though unrelated to regional unemployment), among both the higher and lower educated, and especially in the post-Great Recession period. Longitudinally, EU support is positively related to declining regional unemployment, both among the higher and lower educated, but not to increasing regional GDP per capita.}",2024,Journal of European Public Policy,"{education,euroscepticism,political geography,subnational economic conditions}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.04778199549360264
What Did I Say Again? Relating User Needs to Search Outcomes in Conversational Commerce,"{Recent advances in natural language processing and deep learning have accelerated the development of digital assistants. In conversational commerce, these assistants help customers find suitable products in online shops through natural language conversations. During the dialogue, the assistant identifies the customer's needs and preferences and subsequently suggests potentially relevant products. Traditional online shops often allow users to filter search results based on their preferences using facets. Selected facets can also serve as a reminder of how the product base was filtered. In conversational commerce, however, the absence of facets and the use of advanced natural language processing techniques can leave customers uncertain about how their input was processed by the system. This can hinder transparency and trust, which are critical factors influencing customers' purchase intentions. To address this issue, we propose a novel text-based digital assistant that, in the product assessment step, explains how specific product aspects relate to the user's previous utterances to enhance transparency and facilitate informed decision-making. We conducted a user study (N=135) and found a significant increase in user-perceived transparency when natural language explanations and highlighted text passages were provided, demonstrating their potential to extend system transparency to the product assessment step in conversational commerce.}",2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"{chatbot,conversational commerce,conversational search,conversational user interfaces,explanations,product search}",Computer Science,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.0006092938593709866
"Changing Attitudes? Investigating the Link between Couples' Pandemic Behavior, Cognitive Dissonance, and Gender Role Attitudes in Germany","{Research found that not only macro-level processes like cohort replacements foster gender role attitude (GRA) change, but also life events and changes in lived realities. Framing the COVID-19 pandemic as a ‘natural experiment’ allows to reduce endogeneity when examining the association between emerging cognitive dissonance and GRA change. Estimating asymmetrical fixed effects regressions, I investigate the influence of changes in the division of family labor on GRAs for respondents with no pre-pandemic attitude-behavior discrepancy, using pairfam waves 11 and 13. Indeed, changes in behavior for respondents who had aligned behaviors and attitudes before the pandemic can be associated with GRA adaptation: A change toward an egalitarian division of family labor during the pandemic can be associated with more egalitarian GRAs. Likewise, a change toward an inegalitarian division can be associated with less egalitarian GRAs. These findings support the usefulness of cognitive dissonance as one explanatory mechanism for intra-individual attitudinal change.}",2024,Zeitschrift fur Soziologie,"{cognitive dissonance theory,covid-19 pandemic,division of childcare,division of housework,gender equality,gender role attitudes,pairfam}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

"Socio-emotional experiences of primary school students: Relations to teachers’ underestimation, overestimation, or accurate judgment of their cognitive ability","{Previous research revealed that students who are overestimated in their ability by their teachers experience school more positively than underestimated students. In the present study, we compared the socio-emotional experiences of N = 1516 students whose cognitive abilities were overestimated, accurately judged, or underestimated by their teachers. We applied propensity score matching using students’ cognitive ability, gender, language, parental education, and teacher’s acquaintance with them as covariates for building the three student groups. Matching students on these variables, reduced the original sample size to subsamples with n1 = 348, and n2 = 312 with exact matching including classroom. We compared overestimated, accurately judged, or underestimated students in both matching samples in their socio-emotional profiles (comprised of academic self-concept, joy of learning, attitude towards school, willingness to make an effort, social integration, perceived class climate, and feeling of being accepted by the teacher) by linear discriminant analyses. Groups significantly differed in their profiles. Overestimated students had the most positive socio-emotional experiences of school, followed by accurately judged students. Underestimated students experienced school most negatively. Differences in experiences were most pronounced for the learning environment (medium to large effects for academic self-concept, joy of learning, and willingness to make an effort; negligible effect for attitude towards school) and less for the social environment (medium effects for feeling of being accepted by the teacher; negligible effects for social integration and perceived class climate).}",2024,Social Psychology of Education,"{cognitive ability,primary school,propensity score matching,socio-emotional experiences,teacher judgment accuracy}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.8487592972437185
Panel Conditioning in A Probability-based Longitudinal study: A Comparison of Respondents with Different Levels of Survey Experience,"{Learning effects due to repeated interviewing, also known as panel conditioning, are a major threat to response quality in later waves of a panel study. To date, research has not provided a clear picture regarding the circumstances, mechanisms, and dimensions of potential panel conditioning effects. In particular, the effects of conditioning frequency, that is, different levels of experience within a panel, on response quality are underexplored. Against this background, we investigated the effects of panel conditioning by using data from the GESIS Panel, a German mixed-mode probability-based panel study. Using two refreshment samples, we compared three panel cohorts with differing levels of experience on several response quality indicators related to the mechanisms of reflection, satisficing, and social desirability. Overall, we find evidence for both negative (i.e., disadvantageous for response quality) and positive (i.e., advantageous for response quality) panel conditioning. Highly experienced respondents were more likely to satisfice by speeding through the questionnaire. They also had a higher probability of refusing to answer sensitive questions than less experienced panel members. However, more experienced respondents were also more likely to optimize the response process by needing less time compared to panelists with lower experience levels (when controlling for speeding). In contrast, we did not find significant differences with respect to the number of ""don't know""responses, nondifferentiation, the selection of first response categories and mid-responses, and the number of nontriggered filter questions. Of the observed differences, speeding showed the highest magnitude with an average increase of 6.0 percentage points for highly experienced panel members compared to low experienced panelists.}",2024,Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology,"{data quality,longitudinal surveys,panel conditioning,probability-based panel study}",Mathematics,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",1.0
Revisiting The Classics: A Study on Identifying and Rectifying Gender Stereotypes in Rhymes and Poems,"{Rhymes and poems are a powerful medium for transmitting cultural norms and societal roles.

Past works have shown that stereotyping and prejudice emerge in early childhood, and developmental research on causal mechanisms is critical for understanding and controlling stereotyping and prejudice. This work contributes by gathering a dataset of rhymes and poems to identify gender stereotypes and propose a model with 97% accuracy to identify gender bias. Gender stereotypes were rectified using a Large Language Model (LLM) and its effectiveness was evaluated in a comparative survey against human educator rectifications. To summarize, this work highlights the pervasive nature of gender stereotypes in literary works and reveals the potential of LLMs to rectify gender stereotypes.

Inductive Reasoning Model,"{We introduce the Inductive Reasoning Model (IRM) as a comprehensive platform for the study of several phenomena central to self- and social perception. Going beyond the traditional phenomenon-focused research strategy, the model shows how to generate point-specific hypotheses about the size of individual effects and how to predict the interrelations among phenomena of interest. The model points to additional psychological processes at play when outputs cannot be accounted for within the confines of the IRM alone. The IRM is parsimonious in its assumptions and generative in its predictions. Using two empirically-based inputs, namely, the positivity of a person’s self-image and the strength of social projection, the model predicts the direction and extent of four higher-order phenomena: intergroup accentuation, self-enhancement, ingroup favoritism, and differential accuracy. The model affords precise predictions pertaining to the relationships among these phenomena. Critically, alternative conceptions of social perceptions are not rendered irrelevant. Researchers can ask if the IRM over- or underpredicts social-perceptual phenomena in contexts of interest, and if alternative models can explain the differences.}",2024,Psychological Inquiry,"{inductive reasoning,model,social perception,theoretical}",,SS,14,"arguments, quality, mining, language model, artificial intelligence",0.42558371343833895
The Voice of the Absent?

However, we know little about the underlying mechanisms of this bias or the measures that could compensate for it.

Building on arguments for descriptive representation, I argue that members of the working class experience similar living situations and life chances that form their preferences. Consequently, working-class politicians may be better suited to representing working-class views. The results confirm lower congruence levels between the political elite and working-class citizens. However, class-based preference gaps among politicians are relatively small, and politicians’ social class appears to have a limited impact on compensating for the representational inequality of the working class.}",2024,Political Studies,"{congruence,descriptive and substantive representation,parliamentary candidates,political parties,working class}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.03765695207504455

We argue that the capabilities of instruction-following large language models (LLMs) to leverage knowledge across contexts enable a much more reliable assessment. Rather than just fine-tuning LLMs towards leaderboard chasing on assessment tasks, they need to be instructed systematically with argumentation theories and scenarios as well as with ways to solve argument-related problems.

This study investigates, from an individual perspective, the effect of issue congruency in political ads on immediate responses and voting behaviors. To reach our goal, we combined different types of data collection: mobile experience sampling method (mESM), panel survey, and content analysis. The combined approach allowed us to effectively study targeted ads within the cross-device and cross-platform environment. The results showed that voters perceive online political ads that are about a topic that they care about as more interesting, informative, and persuasive regardless of their partisanship. This positive ad perception subsequently leads to a higher probability of voting for the promoted party in the ad. We also found that an ad discussing a topic in line with the receiver’s concerns positively affects the evaluation of the promoted party in the ad only when the party is already favored by the voter. Taken together, this study provides insights into the conditional effectiveness of data-driven strategies in political campaigns.}",2024,Information Communication and Society,"{data-driven campaigning,issue congruency,mobile experience sampling method,panel survey,vote choice}",Social Sciences,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",0.7869656535186716

We applied propensity score matching using students’ cognitive ability, gender, language, parental education, and teacher’s acquaintance with them as covariates for building the three student groups. Matching students on these variables, reduced the original sample size to subsamples with n1 = 348, and n2 = 312 with exact matching including classroom. We compared overestimated, accurately judged, or underestimated students in both matching samples in their socio-emotional profiles (comprised of academic self-concept, joy of learning, attitude towards school, willingness to make an effort, social integration, perceived class climate, and feeling of being accepted by the teacher) by linear discriminant analyses. Groups significantly differed in their profiles. Overestimated students had the most positive socio-emotional experiences of school, followed by accurately judged students. Underestimated students experienced school most negatively. Differences in experiences were most pronounced for the learning environment (medium to large effects for academic self-concept, joy of learning, and willingness to make an effort; negligible effect for attitude towards school) and less for the social environment (medium effects for feeling of being accepted by the teacher; negligible effects for social integration and perceived class climate).}",2024,Social Psychology of Education,"{cognitive ability,primary school,propensity score matching,socio-emotional experiences,teacher judgment accuracy}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.8241012230674926

EyeLiveMetrics: Real-time Analysis of Online Reading with Eye Tracking,"{Existing eye tracking software have certain limitations, especially with respect to monitoring reading online: (1) Most eye tracking software record eye tracking data as raw coordinates and stimuli as screen images/videos, but without inherent links between both. Analysts must draw areas of interest (AOIs) on webpage text for more fine-grained reading analysis. (2) The computation and analysis of fixation and reading metrics are done after the experiment and thus cannot be used for live applications. We present EyeLiveMetrics, a browser plugin that automatically maps raw gaze coordinates to text in real time. The plugin instantly calculates, stores, and provides fixation, saccade, and reading measures on words and paragraphs so that gaze behavior can be analyzed immediately. We also discuss the results of a comparative evaluation.

Big Five Domains and Facets Contextualized to the Work Domain Outperform Noncontextualized Ones,"{It is well-established that personality predicts a broad range of outcomes across life domains. However, the criterion validity of personality assessments is often limited. One strategy to increase criterion validity is to move from global, noncontextualized personality assessments toward contextualized personality assessments with reference to a specific context. We investigated whether a Big Five assessment contextualized to the work domain allows for better predictions of work-related outcomes than a noncontextualized Big Five assessment. Two hundred ninety respondents completed both the standard Big Five Inventory-2 (BFI-2) and a work-specific variant thereof. In addition, they provided information on a broad range of work-related outcomes (job satisfaction, turnover intentions, organizational citizenship behavior, burnout risk, and occupational commitment), as well as on global health, a not strictly work-related outcome. Results showed that the contextualized personality assessment generally outperformed the noncontextualized one in terms of criterion validity for all outcomes, with the exception of global health. This applied to both the five broad personality domains and the 15 narrow personality facets. We conclude that if maximizing criterion validity in the work domain is the goal, contextualized personality assessments are preferable to noncontextualized ones.}",2024,Journal of Individual Differences,"{big five domains and facets,contextualized personality assessment,criterion validity,work domain}",,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
"Putting authoritarianism in context: A multilevel analysis of regional effects on individual expressions of right-wing authoritarianism, conspiracy mentality, and superstition","{Ever since its original conception, authoritarianism is claimed to be the driving force behind various forms of anti-modern attitudes and politics. While current research mainly focuses on three dimensions of right-wing authoritarianism, namely authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, and conventionalism, the original F-scale was more extensive, including conspiracy mentality and superstition among others. Based on recent empirical observations as well as theoretical claims, this chapter suggests revisiting these concepts. Using a German representative sample (N = 2,522), notable differences between East and West Germany for all five subdimensions were observed in 2022. Multilevel analyses were used to identify and disentangle individual factors as well as sociostructural context factors, which may be responsible for these differences and codetermine the prevalence of the dimensions of authoritarian attitudes. Our analyses reveal that significant regional differences, which go beyond mere East-West differences in authoritarian attitudes in Germany, can partly be explained by the selected context variables. Moreover, collective experiences of deprivation interact with average household income on the district level, and this interaction helps predict authoritarian aggression and submission as well as conspiracy mentality. Nevertheless, individual variables explain more variance overall than contextual variables, particularly in the case of conspiracy mentality and superstition.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.43060836023385884
Between urgency and data quality: assessing the FAIRness of data in social science research on the COVID-19 pandemic,"{Balancing speed and quality during crises pose challenges for ensuring the value and utility of data in social science research. The COVID-19 pandemic in particular underscores the need for high-quality data and rapid dissemination. Given the importance of behavioural measures and compliance with measures to contain the pandemic, social science research has played a key role in policymaking during this global crisis. This study addresses two key research questions: How FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) are social science data on the COVID-19 pandemic? Which study features are related to the level of FAIRness scores of datasets? We assess the FAIRness of n = 1131 articles, retrieved through a keyword search in the Web of Science database, employing both automated and manual coding methods. Our study inclusion criteria encompass empirical studies on the COVID-19 pandemic published between 2019 and 2023 with a social science focus and explicit reference to the underlying dataset(s). Our analysis of n = 45 datasets reveals substantial differences in FAIRness for different types of research on the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall FAIRness of data is acceptable, although particularly Reusability scores fall short, in both the manual and the automatic assessment. Further, articles explicitly linked to the Social Science concept in the OpenAlex database exhibit a higher mean overall FAIRness value. Based on these results, we derive recommendations for balancing ethical obligations and the potential tradeoff between speed and data (sharing) quality in social-scientific crisis research.}",2024,Research Ethics,"{covid-19 pandemic,crisis research,f-uji assessment tool,fair principles,policy research,social science research}",Arts and Humanities,SS,10,"covid 19 pandemic, trust, actor, social science, hybrid",1.0
The interplay of structural features and observed dissimilarities among centrality indices,"{An abundance of centrality indices has been proposed which capture the importance of nodes in a network based on different structural features. While there remains a persistent belief that similarities in outcomes of indices is contingent on their technical definitions, a growing body of research shows that structural features affect observed similarities more than technicalities. We conduct a series of experiments on artificial networks to trace the influence of specific structural features on the similarity of indices which confirm previous results in the literature. Our analysis on 1163 real-world networks, however, shows that little of the observations on synthetic networks convincingly carry over to empirical settings. Our findings suggest that although it seems clear that (dis)similarities among centralities depend on structural properties of the network, using correlation type analyses do not seem to be a promising approach to uncover such connections.}",2024,Social Networks,"{centrality,correlation,network topology,threshold graphs}",Social Sciences,SS,27,"family, network, italy, united states, correlation",1.0
The “Free Voters”: A Decent Alternative for Conservatives?,"{The Free Voters (Freie Wähler) party is becoming a more serious competitor in the German party system. It gained parliamentary representation in the Rhineland Palatine in 2021 and has been governing with the Christian Social Union in Bavaria since 2018. In addition, the Free Voters party now holds two of the 96 German parliamentary member positions in the European Parliament and is, at the federal level, the extraparliamentary opposition party with the greatest number of votes. Nevertheless, there has, to date, been no analysis examining people’s motives for voting for the Free Voters or exploring their future openness to voting for the party. This article addresses this oversight by identifying factors, based on population-representative data from the 2021 Bundestag elections, that favour openness and voting for this increasingly influential party. Our analysis shows that a more general dissatisfaction with democratic outputs, a conservative attitude, and low perceptions of spatial distance from the political positions of the Free Voters have significant positive effects.}",2024,Politische Vierteljahresschrift,"{free voters,german federal election 2021,german politics,party competition,voter potentials}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Citizens’ Acceptance of Data-Driven Political Campaigning: A 25-Country Cross-National Vignette Study,"{This paper investigates how the acceptance of data-driven political campaigning depends on four different message characteristics. A vignette study was conducted in 25 countries with a total of 14,390 respondents who all evaluated multiple descriptions of political advertisements. Relying on multi-level models, we find that in particular the source and the issue of the message matters. Messages that are sent by a party the respondent likes and deal with a political issue the respondent considers important are rated more acceptable. Furthermore, targeting based on general characteristics instead of individual ones is considered more acceptable, as is a general call to participate in the upcoming elections instead of a specific call to vote for a certain party. Effects differ across regulatory contexts, with the negative impact of both individual targeting and a specific call to vote for a certain party being in countries that have higher levels of legislative regulation.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,"{acceptance,cross-national comparison,data driven campaigns,data-driven campaigning,elections,microtargeting,privacy,privacy regulations,vignette study,vignettes}",,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",1.0
Don’t Keep It Too Simple Simplified Items Do Not Improve Measurement Quality,"{When formulating questionnaire items, generally accepted rules include: Keeping the wording as simple as possible and avoiding double-barreled items. However, the empirical basis for these rules is sparse. The present study aimed to systematically investigate in an experimental design whether simplifying items of a personality scale and avoiding double-barreled items (i.e., items that contain multiple stimuli) markedly increases psychometric quality. Specifically, we compared the original items of the Big Five Inventory-2 – most of which are either double-barreled or can be regarded as complexly formulated – with simplified versions of the items. We tested the two versions using a large, heterogeneous sample (N = 2,234). The simplified versions did not possess better psychometric quality than their original counterparts; rather, they showed weaker factorial validity. Regarding item characteristics, reliability, and criterion validity, no substantial differences were identified between the original and simplified versions. These findings were also replicated for the subsample of lower-educated respondents, who are considered more sensitive to complex item formulations. Our study thus suggests that simplifying item wording and avoiding double-barreled items in a personality inventory does not improve the quality of a questionnaire; rather, using simpler (and consequently more vague) item formulations may even decrease factorial validity.}",2024,European Journal of Psychological Assessment,"{bfi-2,big five,item simplification,low educated,personality assessment}",Psychology,SS,28,"interviewing, performance, pretesting, machine learning, prevalence",1.0

This paper introduces the phenomenon of user moderation, documenting and releasing UMOD, the first dataset of comments in which users act as moderators. UMOD contains 1000 comment-reply pairs from the subreddit r/changemyview with crowdsourced annotations from a large annotator pool and with a fine-grained annotation schema targeting the functions of moderation, stylistic properties (aggressiveness, subjectivity, sentiment), constructiveness, as well as the individual perspectives of the annotators on the task. The release of UMOD is complemented by two analyses which focus on the constitutive features of constructiveness in user moderation and on the sources of annotator disagreements, given the high subjectivity of the task.}",2024,"EACL 2024 - 18th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference",,Arts and Humanities,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.004018395486136521
Asking for Traces: A Vignette Study on Acceptability Norms and Personal Willingness to Donate Digital Trace Data,"{Digital trace data are increasingly used in the social sciences. Given the risks associated with data access via application programming interfaces (APIs) as well as ethical discussions around the use of such data, data donations have been proposed as a methodologically reliable and ethically sound way of collecting digital trace data. While data donations have many advantages, study participants may be reluctant to share their data, for example, due to privacy concerns. To assess which factors in a data donation request are relevant for participants’ acceptance and decisions, we conducted a vignette experiment investigating the general acceptability and personal willingness to donate various data types (i.e., data from GPS, web browsing, LinkedIn/Xing, Facebook, and TikTok) for research purposes. The preregistered study was implemented in the probability-based German Internet Panel (GIP) and gathered responses from n = 3821 participants. Results show that people rate the general acceptability of data donation requests higher than their own willingness to donate data. Regarding the different data types, respondents indicated that they would be more willing to donate their LinkedIn/Xing, TikTok, and GPS data compared to web browsing and Facebook data. In contrast, information about whether the donated data would be shared with other researchers and data security did not affect the responses to the respective donation scenarios. Based on these results, we discuss implications for studies employing data donations.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,"{data donation,data linkage,data sharing consent,digital trace data,privacy attitudes,vignette experiment}",Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.95823303961223
"Incivility in Comparison: How Context, Content, and Personal Characteristics Predict Exposure to Uncivil Content","{Incivility, that is, the breaking of social norms of conversation, is evidently prevalent in online political communication. While a growing literature provides evidence on the prevalence of incivility in different online venues, it is still unclear where and to what extent Internet users are exposed to incivility. This paper takes a comparative approach to assess the levels of incivility across contexts, content and personal characteristics. The pre-registered analysis uses detailed web browsing histories, including public Facebook posts and tweets seen by study participants, in combination with surveys collected during the German federal election 2021 (N = 739). The level of incivility is predicted using Google’s Perspective API and compared across contexts (platforms and campaign periods), content features, and individual-level variables. The findings show that incivility is particularly strong on Twitter and more prevalent in comments than original posts/tweets on Facebook and Twitter. Content featuring political content and actors is more uncivil, whereas personal characteristics are less relevant predictors. The finding that user-generated political content is the most likely source of individuals’ exposure to incivility adds to the understanding of social media’s impact on public discourse.}",2024,Social Science Computer Review,"{election campaigns,incivility,negativity,political information,social media,web browsing data}",,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",1.0
Sexism Detection on a Data Diet,"{There is an increase in the proliferation of online hate commensurate with the rise in the usage of social media. In response, there is also a significant advancement in the creation of automated tools aimed at identifying harmful text content using approaches grounded in Natural Language Processing and Deep Learning. Although it is known that training Deep Learning models require a substantial amount of annotated data, recent line of work suggests that models trained on specific subsets of the data still retain performance comparable to the model that was trained on the full dataset. In this work, we show how we can leverage influence scores to estimate the importance of a data point while training a model and designing a pruning strategy applied to the case of sexism detection. We evaluate the model performance trained on data pruned with different pruning strategies on three out-of-domain datasets and find, that in accordance with other work a large fraction of instances can be removed without significant performance drop. However, we also discover that the strategies for pruning data, previously successful in Natural Language Inference tasks, do not readily apply to the detection of harmful content and instead amplify the already prevalent class imbalance even more, leading in the worst-case to a complete absence of the hateful class.

Individual and gender inequality in computer science: A career study of cohorts from 1970 to 2000,"{Inequality prevails in science. Individual inequality means that most perish quickly and only a few are successful, and gender inequality implies that there are differences in achievements for women and men. Using large-scale bibliographic data and following a computational approach, we study the evolution of individual and gender inequality for cohorts from 1970 to 2000 in the whole field of computer science as it grows and becomes a team-based science. We find that individual inequality in productivity (publications) increases over a scholar’s career but is historically invariant, whereas individual inequality in impact (citations), albeit larger, is stable across cohorts and careers. Gender inequality prevails regarding productivity, but there is no evidence for differences in impact. The Matthew Effect is shown to accumulate advantages to early achievements and to become stronger over the decades, indicating the rise of a “publish or perish” imperative. Only some authors manage to reap the benefits that publishing in teams promises. The Matthew Effect then amplifies initial differences and propagates the gender gap.

Toeing the Party Line: Election Manifestos as a Key to Understand Political Discourse on Twitter,"{Political discourse on Twitter is a moving target: politicians continuously make statements about their positions. It is therefore crucial to track their discourse on social media to understand their ideological positions and goals. However, Twitter data is also challenging to work with since it is ambiguous and often dependent on social context, and consequently, recent work on political positioning has tended to focus strongly on manifestos (parties' electoral programs) rather than social media. In this paper, we extend recently proposed methods to predict pairwise positional similarities between parties from the manifesto case to the Twitter case, using hashtags as a signal to fine-tune text representations, without the need for manual annotation. We verify the efficacy of fine-tuning and conduct a series of experiments that assess the robustness of our method for low-resource scenarios. We find that our method yields stable positioning reflective of manifesto positioning, both in scenarios with all tweets of candidates across years available and when only smaller subsets from shorter time periods are available. This indicates that it is possible to reliably analyze the relative positioning of actors forgoing manual annotation, even in the noisier context of social media.}",2024,"EMNLP 2024 - 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Findings of EMNLP 2024",,Computer Science,SS,26,"discourse, social media, polarization, scenarios, election",1.0

Improving media trust research through better measurement: An item response theory perspective,"{While trust in news media has come to the forefront of scholarly and public debate in recent years, academic researchers have raised persistent concern that measurement issues have prevented a better understanding of the concept. This research introduces an item response theory (IRT) perspective to advance the state-of-the-art in media trust measurement beyond recent conceptual and analytical progress. I argue that standard survey instruments that concentrate on the perceived believability of news media restrict our capability to measure truly low media trust. Furthermore, I suggest an important yet previously unnoticed pathway to overcoming this restriction in a scale by Abdulla et al. that captures currency perceptions alongside believability perceptions. Using a representative survey conducted in Germany, I find robust empirical evidence that capturing currency vs. believability perceptions significantly impacts our ability to accurately measure lower vs. higher levels of media trust. The findings have implications for not only studies of media trust’s associations with antecedent and consequential constructs but any attempt to determine the true amount and divergence of citizens’ media trust. More generally, the results demonstrate how IRT aids in putting scholarly debates on the dimensionality and interplay of trust with distrust on more common and fruitful grounds.}",2024,Journal of Trust Research,"{confirmatory item factor analysis,item response theory,measurement,media trust,news credibility,news media,survey research}","Business, Management and Accounting",SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",1.0

We employed automatic identification for the individual’s gender expression (female/male) and the calculation of the face-to-body ratio of individuals depicted.

Why we need to abandon fixed cutoffs for goodness-of-fit indices: An extensive simulation and possible solutions,"{To evaluate model fit in confirmatory factor analysis, researchers compare goodness-of-fit indices (GOFs) against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI >.950) derived from simulation studies. Methodologists have cautioned that cutoffs for GOFs are only valid for settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which cutoffs originated. Despite these warnings, fixed cutoffs for popular GOFs (i.e., χ2, χ2/df, CFI, RMSEA, SRMR) continue to be widely used in applied research. We (1) argue that the practice of using fixed cutoffs needs to be abandoned and (2) review time-honored and emerging alternatives to fixed cutoffs. We first present the most in-depth simulation study to date on the sensitivity of GOFs to model misspecification (i.e., misspecified factor dimensionality and unmodeled cross-loadings) and their susceptibility to further data and analysis characteristics (i.e., estimator, number of indicators, number and distribution of response options, loading magnitude, sample size, and factor correlation). We included all characteristics identified as influential in previous studies. Our simulation enabled us to replicate well-known influences on GOFs and establish hitherto unknown or underappreciated ones. In particular, the magnitude of the factor correlation turned out to moderate the effects of several characteristics on GOFs. Second, to address these problems, we discuss several strategies for assessing model fit that take the dependency of GOFs on the modeling context into account. We highlight tailored (or “dynamic”) cutoffs as a way forward. We provide convenient tables with scenario-specific cutoffs as well as regression formulae to predict cutoffs tailored to the empirical setting of interest.}",2024,Behavior Research Methods,"{confirmatory factor analysis,fit index,goodness-of-fit,ordered categorical data,structural equation modeling}",Arts and Humanities,SS,21,"modeling, detection, correlation, gender, depth",1.0

Creating a homogenous integrated dataset from heterogeneous source data is the domain of ex-post harmonization. The harmonization process involves various considerations.

This issue of conceptual comparability is a fundamental precondition for pooling different source variables to form a harmonized target variable. Our paper explores this issue with a mixed-methods approach. On the one hand, we use psychometric latent variable modeling by presenting several single-item wordings for social trust to respondents and then performing factor analytic procedures. On the other hand, we complement and contrast these quantitative findings with qualitative findings gained with an open-ended web probe. The combined approach gave valuable insights into the conceptual comparability of the eleven social-trust-related single-item wordings. For example, we find that negative, distrust-related wordings and positive, trust-related wordings should not be pooled into an integrated variable. However, the paper will also illustrate and discuss why it is easier to disprove conceptual comparability than fully prove it.}",2024,Quality and Quantity,"{comparability,harmonization,integrated data analysis,mixedmethods,survey methodology}",Mathematics,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",1.0

It will explain how the perspectives taken in the following parts and individual chapters tie together to form a picture of transformation processes in Germany. Second, this chapter serves as a methodological guide through different statistical approaches that may be used to analyze societal and individual changes over time by pointing out common pitfalls of study designs and methods used in transformation research.

Antisemitism in East and W est Germany: Three decades after the wall: a comparative longitudinal study considering age-period-cohort effects,"{Since the unification of the two German states in 1990, antisemitic attitudes have been repeatedly polled in cross-sectional or longitudinal national surveys (e.g., the long-term GFE surveys). So far, comparative studies analyzing the development of antisemitism in East and West Germany over a longer time period are scarce. The study covers a time span of 30 years to investigate two forms of antisemitism (classical and secondary), especially with respect to inner-German differences. Applying model-based age-period-cohort analyses (APC) with a total of 19 available representative surveys (maximal period: 1991-2021), theory-driven hypotheses are tested. The statistical approach and respective findings are discussed with emphasis on several challenges accompanying the utilized heterogenous data and different survey modes. Findings reveal that life-cycle effects play a decisive role in the attitudinal development and distribution of antisemitic attitudes. Moreover, approval of antisemitism is to some extent cohort related in both East and West Germany, while disentangling period effects empirically poses challenges due to data limitations. Furthermore, the observed APC structures differ for classical and secondary antisemitism. The chapter concludes with a critical discussion of the results, limitations, and some further thoughts on the open science philosophy in applied social science research.}",2024,Thirty Years After the Berlin Wall: German Unification and Transformation Research,,,SS,19,"chapter, processes, germany, changes, political attitudes",0.9115130211002449
Harmony or Cacophony? A Disaggregated Analysis of Aid Fragmentation,"{Aid effectiveness is widely understood to suffer when multiple donors operate in the same space, but recent studies indicate benefits of fragmentation. We posit that these mixed findings may reflect differences across aid sectors — and also show how the level of implementation can condition the interpretation of results. Cross-national time-series analysis of 152 countries implies aid fragmentation can promote child survival and improve governance. However, analysis of subnational variation in Sierra Leone and Nigeria suggests the presence of more donors is associated with worse health outcomes, but better governance outcomes. Having more donors in a locality may thus be beneficial when they are working to improve the systems through which policies are implemented, but harmful if they target policy outcomes directly. A survey of Nigerian civil servants suggests potential mechanisms: fragmentation in health aid may lead to internal “brain drain” and pressure to alter projects, whereas diversity in governance aid might promote meritocratic behavior.}",2024,Studies in Comparative International Development,"{africa,aid effectiveness,development assistance,foreign aid,governance}",Social Sciences,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",0.24712766226280736
Using Machine Translation and Post-Editing in the TRAPD Approach: Effects on the Quality of Translated Survey Texts,"{A highly controlled experimental setting using a sample of questions from the European Social Survey (ESS) and European Values Study (EVS) was used to test the effects of integrating machine translation and post-editing into the Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pretesting, and Documentation (TRAPD) approach in survey translation.

The overall results of this study are positive for integrating machine translation and post-editing into the TRAPD process, when translating survey questionnaires. The experiments show evidence that in German and Russian languages and for a sample of ESS and EVS survey questions, the effect of integrating machine translation and post-editing on the quality of the review outputs—with quality understood as texts output with the fewest errors possible—can hardly be distinguished from the quality that derives from the setting with human translations only.}",2024,Public Opinion Quarterly,,Social Sciences,SS,17,"split, questionnaire, errors, machine, languages",1.0
AI-Generated Faces in the Real World: A Large-Scale Case Study of Twitter Profile Images,"{Recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI) have blurred the lines between authentic and machine-generated content, making it almost impossible for humans to distinguish between such media. One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052 % were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.}",2024,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,"{ai-generated content,fake image detection,social networks}",Computer Science,SS,21,"modeling, detection, correlation, gender, depth",0.9999708296685454

Beyond Facts: 4th International Workshop on Computational Methods for Online Discourse Analysis,"{Expressing opinions and interacting with others on the Web has led to the production of an abundance of online discourse data, such as claims and viewpoints on controversial topics, their sources and contexts (events, entities). This data constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. Computational methods, mostly from the field of NLP, have emerged that tackle a wide range of tasks in this context, including argument and opinion mining, claim detection, checkworthiness detection, stance detection or fact verification. However, computational models require robust definitions of classes and concepts under investigation. Thus, these computational tasks require a strong interdisciplinary and epistemological foundation, specifically with respect to the underlying definitions of key concepts such as claims, arguments, stances, check-worthiness or veracity. This requires a highly interdisciplinary approach combining expertise from fields such as communication studies, computational linguistics and computer science. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across communities. From a computational perspective, in order to address this complexity, the synergy of multiple approaches, coming both from symbolic (knowledge representation) and statistical AI seem to be promising to tackle such challenges. This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the analysis of societal debates on the Web. Beyond research into information and knowledge extraction, data consolidation and modeling for knowledge graphs building, the workshop targets communities focusing on the analysis of online discourse, relying on methods from machine learning, natural language processing, large language models and Web data mining.}",2024,WWW 2024 Companion - Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference,"{computational fact-checking,computational journalism,intent detection,knowledge graphs,language models,mis- and disinformation spread and detection,online discourse analysis,social web mining,stance / viewpoint discovery}",Computer Science,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",0.9620036494291393
Retrievability in an integrated retrieval system: an extended study,"{Retrievability measures the influence a retrieval system has on the access to information in a given collection of items. This measure can help in making an evaluation of the search system based on which insights can be drawn. In this paper, we investigate the retrievability in an integrated search system consisting of items from various categories, particularly focussing on datasets, publications and variables in a real-life digital library. The traditional metrics, that is, the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient, are employed to visualise the diversity in retrievability scores of the three retrievable document types (specifically datasets, publications, and variables). Our results show a significant popularity bias with certain items being retrieved more often than others. Particularly, it has been shown that certain datasets are more likely to be retrieved than other datasets in the same category. In contrast, the retrievability scores of items from the variable or publication category are more evenly distributed. We have observed that the distribution of document retrievability is more diverse for datasets as compared to publications and variables.}",2024,International Journal on Digital Libraries,"{dataset retrieval,diversity,interactive ir,retrievability}",Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.36585483210941516
Social media posts as source for political news coverage inside and outside election campaigns: Examining effects on deliberative news media quality,"{Journalists increasingly cite and/or embed social media posts in news articles. While social media posts have been found to be of little deliberative quality, we do not know whether this also affects the deliberative quality of the news. Against the background of a hybrid media system and deliberative news media standards, we answer this research question with a content analysis of news articles including or not including posts from X (formerly Twitter) in the twelve widest-reaching German news websites prior and after the German general election 2021. We were particularly interested in the differences inside and outside election campaigns as the interdependence of the mass media and the political sphere is particularly pronounced during campaign periods. Results show that posts are more often cited and/or embedded in news articles inside than outside election campaigns. Articles including posts feature a greater number of actors but are not more diverse as mainly actors from the political center are referenced. Moreover, articles with posts are associated with a higher position responsiveness but on the other hand a decreased civility of the represented political discourse. This pattern only emerged inside but not outside campaign periods. These findings add to our understanding of contemporary hybrid media systems and the nature of political journalism during contentious political periods.}",2024,Journalism,"{content analysis,deliberation,hybrid media system,media quality,political journalism}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",1.0
Did You Like the Interview? Interviewer Effects on Respondents’ Interview Pleasantness Ratings,"{Although it has long been acknowledged that interviewers play a crucial role in the survey data collection process, there is little research concerning interviewer effects on how respondents perceive the interview. We investigate whether interviewer effects exist regarding how much respondents report having enjoyed the interview and whether these effects can be explained by interviewer characteristics. We use data from wave 9 of the German Family Panel pairfam, combined with data from an interviewer survey conducted prior to this wave. Applying multilevel models, we find large interviewer effects that can be explained only partly by interviewers’ sociodemographic characteristics, attitudes, and behavior. Interviewers’ gender, intrinsic work motivation, and their attitude toward respondents significantly affect how much respondents enjoy the interview.}",2024,Field Methods,,Social Sciences,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",0.022819613781715466
Life Satisfaction during the Second Lockdown of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Germany: The Effects of Local Restrictions and Respondents’ Perceptions about the Pandemic,"{This study examines the consequences of the pandemic on subjective well-being. First, we investigate to what extent regional and temporal differences in COVID-19 restrictions can explain individuals’ life satisfaction in Germany. Second, we examine to what extent “subjective” evaluations of the pandemic are related to life satisfaction. Third, we examine whether these relationships vary with gender, parenthood, and partnership status, or whether relationships changed regarding specific sub-populations (i.e., mothers, fathers, childless women/ men). Merging representative survey data from the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA) and contextual data on COVID-19 restrictions (i.e., the stringency index), we analyze a sample of 32,258 individuals living in Germany in their regional settings on the NUTS-3 level during the “second lockdown” in spring 2021. Furthermore, we use the FReDA field period between April and June 2021 to assess temporal variations in COVID-19 restrictions and their association with life satisfaction. To answer our research questions, we compare aggregated means and use variance decomposition and multivariate regression models. Our results show strong regional and temporal differences in COVID-19 restrictions, but neither temporal nor regional differences in “subjective” perceived pandemic burden or in life satisfaction at the aggregated level. At the individual level, we find substantive negative associations between perceived pandemic burden and life satisfaction, which are particularly strong among mothers. Our study shows that individuals’ negative perceptions of the pandemic are an important correlate to life satisfaction, whereas regional differences or temporal changes in COVID-19 restrictions appear to be irrelevant for the period under investigation.}",2024,Applied Research in Quality of Life,"{corona,life satisfaction,non-pharmaceutical interventions,parenting,stringency index,subjective well-being (swb)}",Social Sciences,SS,23,"european, governance, crises, attitudes, levels",0.7031414065834649

Partnership Dynamics of LGB People and Heterosexuals: Patterns of First Partnership Formation and First Cohabitation,"{In this study we examine partnership dynamics among people with different sexual orientations in Germany. More specifically, we explore the process of first partnership formation and first cohabitation among men and women who self-identify as heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual. Given the various discriminations against same-sex lifestyles, and the limited opportunities to meet potential partners, we assume that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people form partnerships later in life and less frequently than heterosexuals. We further expect that the constantly improving social and legal climate for sexual minorities will lead to a reduction in differences in partnership behaviour by sexual orientation. We use retrospectively reported partnership biographies from the German Socio-Economic Panel, which was supplemented in 2019 with a boost sample of sexual and gender minority households. Using discrete-time event history models, we analyse nearly 15,000 episodes of being single and nearly 20,000 episodes of living without a partner in the household. Around 4.5% of these episodes are from people who self-identify as LGB. The results clearly show that patterns of partnership and coresidential union formation differ by sexual orientation. People with a homosexual orientation—and to a lesser extent people with a bisexual orientation—are less likely to enter into a first partnership and a first cohabitation than people with a heterosexual orientation. Significant changes occur across cohorts: LGB people from younger birth cohorts enter (cohabiting) partnerships much earlier and more frequently than those from older cohorts. Thus, the union formation patterns of LGB and straight people have converged slightly.}",2024,European Journal of Population,"{cohabitation,heterosexuals,lgb people,life course,partnership formation,sexual orientation}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Careless whisper: Political elite discourses activate national identities for far-right voting preferences,"{While exclusionary national identities are widespread among Europeans, relatively few people vote for the far right in most countries. Thus, an exclusionary identity in many cases does not lead to voting for the most nativist types of parties. We explain this empirical puzzle by showing that these identities need to be activated to become behaviourally relevant. To this end, we analyse longitudinal comparative data of over 135,000 individuals across more than 26 years and 26 countries combining different survey programmes and manifesto data. We use latent class analysis to show that over half of respondents hold exclusionary conceptions of nationhood. Moreover, this type of national identity predicts voting far right. Using multi-level modelling and within-country estimators, we further demonstrate that this relationship is significantly stronger when a country's political elites across all parties become more exclusionary. Taking the activation hypothesis to the test in a European context, we conclude that the effect of national identity is conditional on its prior activation.}",2024,Nations and Nationalism,"{elite discourses,far right,longitudinal analysis,national identity,voting behaviour}",Social Sciences,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",1.0
When your accent betrays you: the role of foreign accents in school-to-work transition of ethnic minority youth in Germany,"{Given the challenges immigrants and their descendants face in entering the labour market, we add to the existing literature by considering a previously neglected explanation: a foreign accent. Using unique data with objective accent measures from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries (CILS4EU), we first establish whether foreign-accent effects could be found in a non-experimental setting. Second, we seek to disentangle the accent effect by human capital, signalling, and discrimination approaches. Finally, we explore the extent to which employment and educational paths of accented speakers reflect their self-selection into the fields of study that lead to occupations for which accented speech is not a precondition. Our findings demonstrate that respondents with a stronger foreign accent are more likely to be found in occupations for which language skills are less essential. This is in line with the human-capital explanation. Self-selection tendencies might also be present, even though the findings are equivocal. Our analyses lend no support to the statistical discrimination explanation, as employers’ perceptions of foreign accents do not vary according to the extent of their contact with accented speakers at work or at home.}",2024,Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,"{accent,immigrants,integration,labour market entry,school-to-work transition}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
United in disagreement: Analyzing policy networks in EU policy making,"{Shared belief systems are generally assumed to forge policy networks. Empirical evidence whether and to what extend shared policy core beliefs create ally networks and under which circumstances shared policy core beliefs are not necessary to form these networks, however, is limited. Based on a novel inferential network approach in combination with mediation analysis, this study investigates the role of belief systems as a link between interest group type and policy preference congruence, ultimately leading to ally networks in the European Union. In order to measure the intervening effect of policy core beliefs, automated text analysis is used. Our results suggest that shared policy core beliefs are a strong mediator for members of the same interest group. In addition, “strange bedfellow” networks between NGOs and businesses do, in fact, lack belief congruence and emerge on issues with low potential for intergroup conflict. This paper makes a contribution to our understanding of ally network formation and adds to the emerging line of research which combines quantitative text with inferential network analysis.}",2024,Review of Policy Research,"{advocacy coalitions,automated text analysis,eu energy policy,inferential network analysis,interest groups}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.026878738564368745

Strategic thinking in the shadow of self-enhancement: Benefits and costs,"{Using a variant of the hide-and-seek game, we show in three studies that self-enhancement can help or hinder strategic thinking. In this guessing game, one player chooses a number while another player tries to guess it. Each player does this either in a random fashion (throwing a mental die) or by active thinking. The structure of the game implies that guessers benefit from thinking about a number, whereas choosers are disadvantaged. Yet, regardless of their role, respondents prefer to actively think about a number. For choosers, the belief they can outthink the opponent amounts to self-enhancement, whereas for guessers, the same belief can be rationally justified. We discuss the implications of the findings for theories of strategic cognition and applications to real-world contexts.}",2024,British Journal of Social Psychology,"{hide-and-seek game,randomization,self-enhancement,strategic reasoning,theory of mind}",Psychology,SS,14,"arguments, quality, mining, language model, artificial intelligence",0.37630389922019236
The Search for Solid Ground in Text as Data: A Systematic Review of Validation Practices and Practical Recommendations for Validation,"{Communication research frequently applies computational text analysis methods (CTAM) to detect and measure social science constructs. However, the validity of these measures can be difficult to assess. In addition, there are hardly any established standards and little guidance for researchers on how to best validate CTAM. But how do these challenges affect current validation practices in applied research? And what practical recommendations for better validation of text-based measures can we derive? To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of current validation practices and qualitative expert interviews. We focused on political communication, a subfield that has arguably played a pioneering role in embracing the application of CTAM in communication research. Our results show that researchers apply a great variety of validation steps, which, however, are rarely selected based on a unified understanding of validity. The qualitative interviews further reinforce this notion, as interviewees bemoan a lack of established guidelines and frameworks for validation. Based on our empirical findings, we then derive practical recommendations to guide researchers on how to approach validation conceptually. Additionally, we provide insight into ongoing research that focuses on applied validation frameworks, designed to provide hands-on guidance to researchers involved in CTAM validation.}",2024,Communication Methods and Measures,,Social Sciences,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
Rethinking political space in Europe: the modernisation and globalisation dimensions,"{This study challenges the conventional conceptualisation of political space in European countries as a two-dimensional socio-economic and socio-cultural structure. Utilising data from the 2024 European Election Study, it argues that no national political space is fully captured by these traditional axes. Instead, it introduces a novel framework based on two overarching socio-economic processes–globalisation and modernisation. The study identifies two core social dimensions that also include economic considerations: the modernisation dimension, which links traditional gender roles and opposition to same-sex marriage with attitudes toward climate change, often accompanied by support for wealth redistribution; and the globalisation dimension, which, although less uniform, consistently centres around immigration. These findings underscore the complexity of political conflict across EU countries and emphasise the role of party strategies, particularly those of far-right parties and mainstream party responses, in shaping voters’ political alignments.}",2025,Journal of European Public Policy,"{dimensionality,european elections,globalisation,modernisation,political space}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.07886776297228763
Assessing Data Quality in the Age of Digital Social Research: A Systematic Review,"{While survey data has long been the focus of quantitative social science analyses, observational and content data, although long-established, are gaining renewed attention; especially when this type of data is obtained by and for observing digital content and behavior. Today, digital technologies allow social scientists to track “everyday behavior” and to extract opinions from public discussions on online platforms. These new types of digital traces of human behavior, together with computational methods for analyzing them, have opened new avenues for analyzing, understanding, and addressing social science research questions. However, even the most innovative and extensive amounts of data are hollow if they are not of high quality. But what does data quality mean for modern social science data? To investigate this rather abstract question the present study focuses on four objectives. First, we provide researchers with a decision tree to identify appropriate data quality frameworks for a given use case. Second, we determine which data types and quality dimensions are already addressed in the existing frameworks. Third, we identify gaps with respect to different data types and data quality dimensions within the existing frameworks which need to be filled. And fourth, we provide a detailed literature overview for the intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives on data quality. By conducting a systematic literature review based on text mining methods, we identified and reviewed 58 data quality frameworks. In our decision tree, the three categories, namely, data type, the perspective it takes, and its level of granularity, help researchers to find appropriate data quality frameworks. We, furthermore, discovered gaps in the available frameworks with respect to visual and especially linked data and point out in our review that even famous frameworks might miss important aspects.

The simulation-cum-ROC approach: A new approach to generate tailored cutoffs for fit indices through simulation and ROC analysis,"{To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥.950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest. Therefore, we propose a novel approach combining a Monte Carlo simulation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. This so-called simulation-cum-ROC approach generates tailored cutoffs and additionally identifies the most reliable fit indices in the setting of interest. We provide R code and a Shiny app for an easy implementation of the approach. No prior knowledge of Monte Carlo simulations or ROC analysis is needed to generate tailored cutoffs with the simulation-cum-ROC approach.}",2025,Behavior Research Methods,"{confirmatory factor analysis,cutoff,fit indices,roc,structural equation modeling}",Psychology,SS,21,"modeling, detection, correlation, gender, depth",1.0
Non-binary experiences of (gender-based) violence at work,"{The experiences of non-binary people remain underexplored in HRM research. With limited knowledge and evidence, putting in place diversity management policies and practices is challenging. This article advances understandings of the experiences of non-binary people at work by providing empirical evidence from a survey conducted in 15 countries across Europe with nearly 18,000 staff at universities and research organisations, including 173 who identified as non-binary. Results suggest that non-binary people are more likely than other gender identity groups to feel socially excluded and unsafe at work, as well as more likely to be subjected to psychological violence and sexual harassment. The analysis shows that experiences of gender-based violence mediate the relationship between being non-binary and feeling socially excluded, unsafe or unwell at work. By integrating minority stress theory into the study of workplace inequalities, this research deepens the understanding of how systemic stigmatisation operates within gendered and binarist organisations. These findings emphasise the need to integrate considerations of gender-based violence into diversity management interventions and disrupt binary gender norms to ensure inclusion and safety at work.

The article argues that to better understand gender-based violence in universities and research institutions, analyses need to be intersectional and contextual. Such approaches go beyond binary understandings of gender and narrow legalistic definitions of gender-based violence. The article reflects on how to operationalize this to derive starting points for intersectional categories to consider and contextual factors to measure at micro-, meso-, and macro-levels. It concludes that a multilevel intersectional analysis leads to more nuanced knowledge on experiences of gender-based violence and is, therefore, better equipped to inform the development of measures to eradicate the problem in an inclusive way.}",2025,Violence Against Women,"{gender-based violence,intersectionality,research-performing organizations,surveys,theorizing quantitative measurement}",Social Sciences,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",1.0
Are there limits to empathy? A survey experiment on empathic concern and perspective-taking as bases for attitudes towards different groups of refugees,"{This article examines how empathic concern and perspective-taking influence different exclusionary attitudes towards refugees. More specifically, we investigate how empathic competence underpins social distance towards refugees and the opposition to granting them civil rights. Furthermore, we explore the potential constraints of this relationship by investigating the moderating role of different refugee characteristics via a survey-experimental approach using single-wave data from the GESIS Panel, a representative survey conducted in Germany. The refugee characteristics relate to having a Muslim versus Christian background and having high versus low qualifications, implying different levels of intergroup threat. The results indicate that higher levels of perspective-taking and empathic concern are associated with lower social distance towards refugees and opposition to granting rights to refugees. Furthermore, while the respondents’ exclusionary attitudes were higher towards certain refugee groups, implying higher levels of intergroup threat, empathic concern and perspective-taking predicted more positive attitudes towards the different groups of refugees equally. This implies that the effect of empathy does not depend on out-group characteristics.}",2025,European Societies,"{empathy,intergroup threat,out-group attitudes,refugees}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.14339621280249235
How Relevant is NIMBYism to Citizens’ Support for the Large-Scale Deployment of Public Goods? Experimental Evidence from 5G Antenna Placement in Switzerland,"{Supplying society-wide public goods often depends on site-specific provision. Yet, (perceived) localized provision costs may at times outweigh localized individual benefits and thus lead to “not-in-my-backyard” (NIMBY-)opposition (e.g., when trying to set up energy, transportation, social, or, in our case, communication infrastructure). Accurate estimation of the level of NIMBY-opposition per se is analytically challenging because general attitudes towards provision and NIMBY-motivated opposition are intertwined but need to be distinguished and because site selection can be endogenous to local support/opposition. We conducted an experiment that addresses these challenges, focusing on public attitudes toward 5G antenna placement in Switzerland. Using original data from a population-representative sample of Swiss residents (), we observe a population split on the question of 5G network expansion. We survey-experimentally revealed actual 5G antenna locations around respondent homes to a sample largely unaware of these locations beforehand. This information increased individuals’ worry over proximity to antenna sites and reduced support for 5G rollout, with such effects becoming stronger with closer proximity. Differentiating respondents with ex ante higher perceived costs/lower perceived benefits and lower costs/higher benefits from provision, the former are more opposed to 5G rollout, regardless of distance. In contrast, the latter exhibit particularly pronounced NIMBY attitudes. This allows for unexpected political coalitions that, in our case, could affect majority support.

How affect shapes online information seeking about political actors,"{Search engines are both frequently used and widely trusted sources of current political information. While research has examined the different stages of information seeking via search, the question of how political preferences and sociodemographic factors impact political online search has received less attention. In particular, the way in which attitudinal factors, such as sentiment toward a politician or interest in their personal life motivate information seeking have not been widely studied. We present findings from a panel study that combines browser tracking data with survey results for 1863 German participants. Our results suggest that both sympathy and antipathy toward a selection of popular politicians is predictive of searching for them. Queries also vary in their composition, with searches for female politicians highlighting their personal lives and physical attributes somewhat more often than for males. We conclude that the role of “soft” factors in motivating information seeking on political actors remains underexplored.}",2025,New Media and Society,"{affect,gender,information seeking,online search engines,political communication}",Social Sciences,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",1.0
Linking survey and Facebook data: mechanisms of consent and linkage,"{Using a German online panel, we investigate respondents’ propensity to consent to the linkage of publicly available Facebook data to their survey data and to enable linkage. We analyse the effects of three experimental variations on consent and linkage among Facebook users: (1) the consent question wording, (2) the position of the Facebook consent question in a series of consent questions, and (3) the incentive offered. To describe potential selection bias, we consider respondents’ attitudes and sociodemographic characteristics. We found effects of consent question placement on consent and linkage and effects of higher incentives on linkage, but we found no effects of question wording. Our analysis also showed that linkage was dependent on privacy and data security concerns, trust in the data-collecting actor, respondents’ attitudes toward surveys, and several sociodemographic characteristics.}",2025,International Journal of Social Research Methodology,"{consent,data linkage,experiment,facebook,online survey}",,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",0.1329882199103787

Consequently, the critical evaluation of norm quality and meaning is difficult for test users and reviewers. Because a specific standard for reporting on standardized scores is lacking, we developed Guidelines for Reporting on Norm-referenced and Criterion-referenced Scores (GRoNC), following a systematic approach for creating reporting guidelines (EQUATOR).

The GRoNC includes a series of questions and associated explanations. It supports test developers in developing and reporting upon their standardized scores, and reviewers in evaluating a psychological test on its standardized scores. We provide recommendations on using the GRoNC and conclude by describing our expectations and plans to increase the impact of the GRoNC on reporting practice.}",2025,Assessment,"{assessment,psychological test,reporting standards,standardized scores,test interpretation}",Psychology,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.21620095977894357
Negative campaigning and electoral mobilization: empirical evidence from German state elections,"{Recent research has been inconclusive about the systemic effects of negative campaigning. The available studies, most of which focus on the United States, either conclude that attack behavior decreases turnout, increases turnout, or has no effect on turnout. This study analyzes the relation between negative campaigning and turnout at the constituency level in 13 German state elections in 2021 and 2024. Based on a triangulation of data from the state returning officers and candidate surveys we show that an overall negative tone of the campaign stimulates voter participation; the predicted difference in turnout between a constituency reporting a low and a constituency reporting a high level of negativity is 2.5 percentage points for the overall campaign and 3.3 percentage points for the candidates’ attack behavior at the constituency level. We conclude that the specific effect of negative campaigning on turnout depends on the level of communication.}",2025,Political Research Exchange,"{candidate survey,germany,negative campaigning,turnout}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.08603513337420457
Forecasting Referendums: A Structural Model Predicting Adoption and Support in Irish Plebiscites 1968–2024,"{Election prediction flourishes among pollsters, the media, academics, and political anoraks, with four significant prognostic paradigms: opinion polls, markets, structural models, and hybrid approaches. Structural models, inspired by political science theory and based on so‐called “fundamental” indicators, have a long pedigree in predicting government performance in elections cross‐nationally. Despite their prevalence and prowess in forecasting contests for government, these structural models have not been applied to predict referendums, where the prognosis game, as far as it exists, primarily relies on polls. Perhaps this is unsurprising given that plebiscites can be especially hard to forecast given that citizens often vote on complex subjects not always salient in public discourse, partisan cues are sometimes lacking, and late opinion shifts are arguably more common than in elections. In this contribution, we break new ground by fusing two strands of political science literature—election forecasting and referendums—and devise a prediction model of plebiscites based on economic, institutional, and historical variables, thereby providing the first structural forecasting model to account for referendum adoption and support levels. We apply this model ex‐post to 42 national referendums in Ireland between 1968 and 2024 to test its applicability ex‐ante. In Europe, Ireland stands third only to Switzerland and Italy as polities that regularly employ referendums to decide public policy issues. With reasonable lead time, ex‐post estimates of our model offer solid predictions of the referendums’ outcome, with out‐of‐sample estimates calling the outcome correctly 68%–79% of the time, a remarkable feat given that the issues up for decision are varied. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model’s predictions are competitive with opinion poll estimates of these contests, illustrating that while our model is not a panacea, it provides a reasonable starting point for predicting the outcomes of referendums in Ireland and, importantly, plants a vital seed for future work on forecasting plebiscites using model approaches.}",2025,Politics and Governance,"{forecasting,ireland,referendums,structural models}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.13445847693565752
Surveying emigrants worldwide–using Facebook and Instagram to recruit respondents in cross-national (e)migration research,"{Sampling remains a major challenge when researching minority populations, especially in cross-national settings. While various sampling methods are established in the field, most of them cannot easily be implemented globally. However, worldwide operating Social Networking Sites provide an opportunity for the recruitment of certain hard-to-reach populations in almost all countries. Targeting German emigrants through paid advertisements on Facebook and Instagram, we aim to ascertain whether such ads could be used to recruit a nonprobability emigrant sample on a global scale. Specifically, we look at two aspects: relative cost efficiency and coverage. Using this approach, we achieved 3,816 completed surveys from emigrants in 148 countries and territories. The method also yielded good results in world regions where other surveys faced severe coverage issues. Furthermore, a considerable share of the sample could not have been reached using German population registers as a sampling frame, which otherwise constitutes the most promising alternative approach.}",2025,Comparative Migration Studies,"{emigrant research,german migration,global migration,meta sampling,migration research methods,survey research}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Beyond rationality. Toward a more comprehensive understanding of the use of negative campaigning,"{Most scholars agree that candidates' use of negative campaigning is based on rational considerations, i.e., weighing likely benefits against potential costs. We argue that this perspective is far too narrow and outline the elements of a comprehensive model on the use of negative campaign communication that builds on personality traits, values, social norms, and attitudes toward negative campaigning as complementary mechanisms to classical rational choice theory. We test our theoretical assumptions using candidate surveys for twelve state elections in Germany with more than 3,100 candidates. Our results strongly suggest that negative campaigning goes beyond rational considerations. Although benefit-cost calculations are the primary driver of the decision to attack the opponent, other factors are also important and enhance our understanding of why candidates choose to engage in negative campaign communication.

Disentangling different types of sexist attitudes and vote choice in Germany,"{With a woman as head of German government for 16 years, many hoped (or feared) for significant progress in the areas of gender equality. Rather than progress, however, contributors have noticed a rising backlash against norms of gender equality worldwide, but also in Germany. These developments have sparked a renewed interest in sexism as an explanation for (political) attitudes and behaviours. The context of the 2021 Bundestag election offers a unique opportunity to investigate the salience of these attitudes on both candidate evaluations and vote choice. We examine the interrelation of sexism, vote choice, and candidate sympathy, employing data that was collected directly before and following the German general elections, tapping into different manifestations of sexism, benevolent, modern and hostile. We find a powerful effect of sexism in more areas than previously theorized — namely negative attitudes towards women candidates and preference for populist radical right parties, but also in vote choice for conservative and liberal parties.}",2025,Political Research Exchange,"{bundestag elections,gender,representation,sexism,vote choice}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.5216874645965873
"Ready or not. National identity, vote choice, and mass media: Evidence from Germany","{Exploiting the increased prominence of debates on immigration, right-wing parties often frame and campaign against immigrants as a threat to national societies. Research on national identity has shown that these parties are particularly successful among voters with an ethnically charged, exclusionary conception of nation. National identity, however, tends to be rather latent and stable, while far-right voting is much more volatile. Explaining a temporal influence of national identity on political behavior, social-psychological theories argue that identities need to be activated to become behaviorally relevant. The main argument of this article is that the presence of immigration-related news in the mass media can serve as such a situational factor for thinking about the nation and thus increase its salience for electoral behavior. Combining individual-level panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study's Short-term Campaign Panel (GLES, 2019) with a measure of media salience of immigration-related news in news articles, this study is the first to examine whether national identity can be activated for political behavior through the salience of immigration-related issues in the mass media using panel data.}",2025,Political Psychology,"{identity activation,media salience,national identity,voting}",Social Sciences,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",1.0
Measuring four facets of emotion beliefs in Germany: A German-language adaptation of the EBQ and its comparability across gender and different emotion abilities,"{Adaptive emotion regulation, involving the modulation of positive and negative emotions based on goals, is a crucial function for a person’s mental health and general well-being. Factors influencing successful emotion regulation include beliefs about emotions, such as the controllability and usefulness of emotions. The Emotion Beliefs Questionnaire (EBQ) was developed to assess these beliefs and has shown promise in predicting emotion regulation and psychopathology across different countries. This study aims to advance EBQ’s generalizability in measuring emotion beliefs by examining the scale’s different validities for a developed German version. In a German sample of 348 respondents, we show the scale’s factorial and broader construct validity as well as its factors’ reliability. Notably, we demonstrate that the German EBQ is mostly strictly measurement invariant across central sociodemographic variables like age and gender.

Our results highlight a strong emphasis on content related to science and engineering, as well as health, particularly in channels managed by individual researchers and academic institutions. However, there is a notable variation in the popularity of these channels, with professional YouTubers and commercial media entities often outperforming in terms of viewer engagement metrics like likes, comments, and views. This underscores the challenge academic channels face in attracting a wider audience. Further, we explore the role of academic actors on YouTube, scrutinizing their impact in disseminating research and the types of publications they reference. Despite a general inclination towards professional academic topics, these channels displayed a varied effectiveness in spotlighting highly cited research.

The educational wealth divide in Europe: Post-secondary enrollment gaps across parental wealth components and countries,"{Parental wealth is a crucial dimension of socioeconomic status (SES) and plays a significant role in the intergenerational transmission of educational advantage. Previous research on the topic has been limited to a small number of countries, and findings on the relationship between parental wealth and educational attainment are hardly comparable across institutional contexts. Furthermore, the specific role of different wealth components remains unclear. This study addresses these gaps by comparing parental wealth-based inequalities in post-secondary enrollment across 15 European countries, using harmonized Household Finance and Consumption Survey data. We assess how different dimensions of parental wealth – net, real, and financial – relate to children's post-secondary enrollment, and how these associations vary across institutional contexts. Our findings reveal substantial enrollment gaps between high- and low-wealth families in all countries, with these disparities remaining significant in ten countries even after accounting for other parental SES dimensions. When considering net wealth, we observe the largest enrollment gaps in Southern and Eastern Europe and smaller gaps in most Continental countries. However, most of country differences are not statistically significant. Real wealth, particularly housing assets, is the strongest predictor of enrollment, whereas the role of household debt is more context-dependent. These results underscore the importance of disaggregating wealth components and considering the specific national context when assessing wealth-related educational inequalities.}",2025,Research in Social Stratification and Mobility,"{educational attainment,europe,inequality,post-secondary enrollment,wealth}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Family Integration and Social Contacts of People from Syria and Eritrea in Germany,"{To date, there has been little research on the extent to which the family integration of new immigrants influences the development of social contacts with people from the host society. There is the possibility that immigrants are less dependent on social exchange with people from the host society as soon as close family members live in Germany with them. Empirical evidence to date does indeed point in this direction, but it rests on a rather narrow foundation. Therefore, using data from the project Forced Migration and Transnational Family Arrangements—Eritrean and Syrian Refugees in Germany (TransFAR), we investigate how the family situation of refugees from Syria or Eritrea living in Germany influences the number of their extra-familial contacts. In contrast to previous studies, we explicitly distinguish between the number of extra-familial intraethnic persons and the number of extra-familial persons originating from Germany. Theoretically, we assume that the benefits resulting from relationships with persons of their own ethnicity should differ from the benefits resulting from relationships with persons originating from Germany. As a consequence, relationships with Germans should hardly replace family contacts, whereas relationships with co-ethnics should more easily substitute for family contacts. In fact, the empirical analyses indicate that family integration does not lead to refugees having fewer relationships with people from the host society, but instead fewer relationships with non-family people of their own ethnicity.}",2025,Kolner Zeitschrift fur Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie,"{family,migrants,networks,refugees,social integration}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.42596803944210326

Using a vignette experiment in Belgium, the analysis explores public preferences for welfare governance within the EU multilevel system, conditional on safeguarding benefit levels. The findings show that, when benefit levels are guaranteed, support for the presented welfare policy is generally neutral to positive across governance levels. This suggests that fears of a ‘race-to-the-bottom’ can be alleviated when citizens are confident that welfare standards will be maintained.

Communicating democratic subversions to citizens,"{In many countries, leaders have violated democratic norms without being punished. Citizens have often acquiesced to such subversions of democracy, despite widespread condemnation of policies by the media, opposing politicians and international organisations. A focal question following from this is whether attempts at persuading citizens to tolerate or oppose subversions of democracy are effective. Building on literature about the role of partisanship in acquiescence to democratic backsliding and subversions of democracy, we ask how communication surrounding democratic subversion shapes this behaviour. Specifically, we question whether the reasons governments and opponents provide for and against policy proposals that subvert democratic norms affect the likelihood that citizens oppose democratic subversions by governments they favour. We conduct a vignette experiment with 1,300 respondents from Germany and Poland, and show that political communication, especially how governments motivate their proposals, has substantial effects on the likelihood that citizens acquiesce to democratic subversions.

Assessing Data Quality in the Age of Digital Social Research: A Systematic Review,"{While survey data has long been the focus of quantitative social science analyses, observational and content data, although long-established, are gaining renewed attention; especially when this type of data is obtained by and for observing digital content and behavior. Today, digital technologies allow social scientists to track “everyday behavior” and to extract opinions from public discussions on online platforms. These new types of digital traces of human behavior, together with computational methods for analyzing them, have opened new avenues for analyzing, understanding, and addressing social science research questions. However, even the most innovative and extensive amounts of data are hollow if they are not of high quality. But what does data quality mean for modern social science data? To investigate this rather abstract question the present study focuses on four objectives. First, we provide researchers with a decision tree to identify appropriate data quality frameworks for a given use case. Second, we determine which data types and quality dimensions are already addressed in the existing frameworks. Third, we identify gaps with respect to different data types and data quality dimensions within the existing frameworks which need to be filled. And fourth, we provide a detailed literature overview for the intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives on data quality. By conducting a systematic literature review based on text mining methods, we identified and reviewed 58 data quality frameworks. In our decision tree, the three categories, namely, data type, the perspective it takes, and its level of granularity, help researchers to find appropriate data quality frameworks. We, furthermore, discovered gaps in the available frameworks with respect to visual and especially linked data and point out in our review that even famous frameworks might miss important aspects.

The simulation-cum-ROC approach: A new approach to generate tailored cutoffs for fit indices through simulation and ROC analysis,"{To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥.950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest. Therefore, we propose a novel approach combining a Monte Carlo simulation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. This so-called simulation-cum-ROC approach generates tailored cutoffs and additionally identifies the most reliable fit indices in the setting of interest. We provide R code and a Shiny app for an easy implementation of the approach.

"What Makes it into the Media? Party Messages, Communication Channels, and Media Outlets","{Media coverage of political actors and debates is a crucial avenue for voters to learn about political parties and their policies. However, nowadays party-media agenda-setting is increasingly shaped by large-scale transformations and the fragmentation of political communication across various party channels (e.g., press releases, social media, speeches) and media types (e.g., newspapers, television, online news), potentially affecting the provision of political information. This article examines these dynamics using large-scale textual data from political parties (n = 17,677) and media outlets (n = 90,531) published in the run-up to the Austrian national election in 2019. Building on the measurement of text similarity with state-of-the-art transformer-based models and multiverse analysis, we investigate the success of party messages from press releases, parliamentary speeches, Facebook and Twitter making it into important national newspapers, online news sites as well as television and radio news programs. The article shows that the variety in party channels and media outlets—with their distinct characteristics, modalities, and (technological) affordances—create different flows of information between the parties and the media. Press releases remain crucial tools for parties to get their messages into the media, while social media and parliamentary speeches also matter, albeit with varying effects by party. We also find that online news is more receptive to party messages than print, television, or radio news. Despite these differences, journalistic gate-keeping consistently favors large and government parties across all media types.

The book also looks at the effects of attack politics, for instance, whether exposure to negative or uncivil messages alters attitudes and behaviors, such as turnout, affective polarization, and support for political violence. The authors provide a systematic conceptualization of attack politics, made up of negativity, incivility, and intolerance. Focusing on cutting- edge research in political psychology, political communication, and electoral behavior, the authors make the central argument that to understand the effects of different forms of attack politics, there should be a strong focus on individual differences in message perception and evaluation. Exploring what ultimately drives the effects of negative, uncivil, and intolerant rhetoric, and analyzing the phenomena at the center of current scientific and public discourse, this is a fascinating reading for academics and students in psychology, political science, sociology, and communication, as well as anyone interested in political campaigning and elections.}",2025,"The Psychology of Attack Politics: Perceptions, Evaluations and Effects",,,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",0.652073155055026

This finding demonstrates that what laypeople perceive as extreme weather is not yet fully understood.}",2025,Climatic Change,"{climate change,extreme weather,objective weather data,public opinion,subjective perceptions of extreme weather}",Earth and Planetary Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",1.0
Capable but Not Empowered? How Emancipative Values Affect Protest Participation Across Different Contexts,"{Political protest and citizen participation are important drivers of democratic change. While previous research has identified both micro-level attitudes such as emancipative values and macro-level factors as drivers of protest behavior, we know little about how citizens’ value-driven motivations interact with the political context. We argue that the effect of emancipative values on protest participation depends on both democratic institutions and the capacity of civil society mobilizations. Specifically, we expect the positive effect of emancipative values to be stronger in countries with higher democratic quality and more pro-democratic mass mobilizations, and weaker in countries with more pro-autocratic mass mobilizations. By combining survey and macro data for 88 democratic and autocratic regimes, we find that citizens’ value orientations interact with democratic quality and the prevalence of pro-autocratic mass mobilizations in shaping protest participation. These results contribute to a better understanding of the structural and societal preconditions for democratic change.}",2025,Political Studies,"{emancipative values,political opportunity structures,political participation,political protest,resource mobilization}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.41963298844540725
Mapping modern kinship networks: First results from the KINMATRIX survey,"{Objective: This study presents initial results from the KINMATRIX survey, a large-scale source of ego-centric network data offering an unprecedented level of scope and detail in mapping family relationships. Background: Research on kinship networks is limited by the scarcity of available data. As a result, key phenomena remain insufficiently understood, including the importance of extended kin, contrasts between kinship lines, and cross-national differences. Notably, extended kin provide a unique “strength in numbers” that can enhance social transmission, integration, and support. Method: We analyzed data from anchor respondents aged 25–35 (N = 11,788 anchors; 239,220 anchor-kin dyads) collected in seven Western countries (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States). Kinship networks included a large array of nuclear, extended, and complex kin (on average, 20 kin per anchor). We used descriptive methods to examine retrospective, current, and prospective assessments of kin ties across four measures: importance, closeness, contact, and support. Results: We report three main findings: First, extended kin are central to younger adults' lives, representing at least half of the family members they are emotionally close to, regularly contact, and deem important. Second, kinship networks are matrilineally tilted. Maternal kin are emotionally closer, more frequently contacted, considered more important, and more supportive. Third, cross-national comparisons reveal both similarities and notable differences, with the United States and Sweden showing elevated importance of extended and complex kin and Italy exhibiting higher social integration with nuclear and extended kin. Conclusion: Data on kinship networks can significantly advance our understanding of key family phenomena.}",2025,Journal of Marriage and Family,"{demography,family relations,family structure,family systems,intergenerational relationships}",Social Sciences,SS,27,"family, network, italy, united states, correlation",1.0

Surveying emigrants worldwide–using Facebook and Instagram to recruit respondents in cross-national (e)migration research,"{Sampling remains a major challenge when researching minority populations, especially in cross-national settings. While various sampling methods are established in the field, most of them cannot easily be implemented globally. However, worldwide operating Social Networking Sites provide an opportunity for the recruitment of certain hard-to-reach populations in almost all countries. Targeting German emigrants through paid advertisements on Facebook and Instagram, we aim to ascertain whether such ads could be used to recruit a nonprobability emigrant sample on a global scale. Specifically, we look at two aspects: relative cost efficiency and coverage. Using this approach, we achieved 3,816 completed surveys from emigrants in 148 countries and territories. The method also yielded good results in world regions where other surveys faced severe coverage issues. Furthermore, a considerable share of the sample could not have been reached using German population registers as a sampling frame, which otherwise constitutes the most promising alternative approach.}",2025,Comparative Migration Studies,"{emigrant research,german migration,global migration,meta sampling,migration research methods,survey research}",Decision Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Between national trends and local realities: Spatializing energy vulnerability in 16 EU countries,"{Capturing energy poverty and its social and spatial inequalities is crucial for understanding the specific needs and effects of place-based energy policies. However, detailed EU cross-country comparisons are still scarce and do not account for the socio-spatial underpinnings of vulnerability to energy poverty. In this article, we construct a small-scale multidimensional energy vulnerability index based on 22 indicators spanning 16 countries from the European Union. Unlike previous EU-wide energy poverty indices, the proposed index captures the multifaceted nature of energy vulnerability using subindices on energy literacy, behavior, material conditions, and climate. We use PCA to combine theoretical and data-driven approaches for index creation. Additionally, we employ a geographically weighted approach that highlights the limitations of national trends compared with local realities. Case studies of Spain, the Netherlands, and Czechia help us map context-specific understandings of energy vulnerability. The vulnerability index presented in this paper constitutes a first attempt at measuring the small-scale socio-spatial nature of energy vulnerability in the EU. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering factors such as energy literacy, behavior, housing conditions, and health disparities in understanding energy injustice. We provide insights into the shifted energy landscapes following a series of political and economic disruptions in Europe.}",2025,Energy Policy,"{energy vulnerability,multidimensional,pca,socio-spatial}",,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.038852894280457774
Mapping and Influencing the Political Ideology of Large Language Models using Synthetic Personas,"{The analysis of political biases in large language models (LLMs) has primarily examined these systems as single entities with fixed viewpoints. While various methods exist for measuring such biases, the impact of persona-based prompting on LLMs' political orientation remains unexplored. In this work we leverage PersonaHub, a collection of synthetic persona descriptions, to map the political distribution of persona-based prompted LLMs using the Political Compass Test (PCT). We then examine whether these initial compass distributions can be manipulated through explicit ideological prompting towards diametrically opposed political orientations: right-authoritarian and left-libertarian. Our experiments reveal that synthetic personas predominantly cluster in the left-libertarian quadrant, with models demonstrating varying degrees of responsiveness when prompted with explicit ideological descriptors. While all models demonstrate significant shifts towards right-authoritarian positions, they exhibit more limited shifts towards left-libertarian positions, suggesting an asymmetric response to ideological manipulation that may reflect inherent biases in model training.}",2025,WWW Companion 2025 - Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2025,"{llms,persona-based prompting,political bias,synthetic personas}",Computer Science,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
Global Profiles of Positive Youth Development: A Person-Oriented Analysis among Emerging Adults Living in 21 Countries,"{Although global research on the 5Cs model of Positive Youth Development (PYD; competence, confidence, connection, character, and caring) has expanded in recent years, there is a lack of understanding about distinct and consistent PYD profiles across youth from diverse socio-cultural contexts. To address this gap, this study utilized a person-oriented analytic approach to examine the PYD profiles of 11,481 emerging adults (Mage = 21.77; SDage = 2.74; 68.66% females) from 21 countries in four continents. Results of the multi-group latent profile analysis revealed four consistent profiles of PYD across countries: high/balanced (41%), self-efficacious (28%), socio-emotional (20%), and low/self-centered (11%). Participants’ age, gender, educational attainment, and country-level collectivism were also found to be associated with specific profiles. Older and more-educated females from less collectivistic countries were more likely to be in a high/balanced profile, while younger males from more collectivistic countries tend to be in a low/self-centered profile. Older and more-educated males from less collectivistic countries were more likely to be in a self-efficacious profile, while younger and less-educated females from more collectivistic countries tend to be in a socio-emotional profile. Controlling these socio-contextual covariates, the four profiles exhibited distinct relations with adaptive (resilience and contribution) and maladaptive outcomes (anxiety and adverse life experiences) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight the importance of fostering a balanced set of Cs, which include both self-efficacious and socio-emotional qualities, to promote positive adaptation in challenging times across diverse developmental settings.}",2025,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,"{5cs,emerging adulthood,multi-group latent profile analysis,person-oriented research,positive youth development}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.20890749178317158
Message order matters: A robust author profiling approach for social media platforms,"{As the order of sentences can impact the meaning of texts, transformer models and recurrent neural networks (RNN) also consider the order of the tokens. However, this feature can negatively affect the classification of social media accounts, as users might share messages on entirely different topics in consecutive order. In this study, we explore how to enhance the performance of models that take into account word order for various author profiling tasks on social media. We first draw attention to the transformer models’ input limit and propose a message selection method that also reduces noise caused by irrelevant messages. In addition, we show that arbitrarily concatenating messages can be problematic. Therefore, we propose creating multiple variants of data by shuffling messages, classifying each variant separately, and then aggregating the predictions. In our comprehensive experiments, we focus on age, gender, occupation, and bot detection tasks. We show that the proposed content selection and shuffling-based methods lead to slight improvements in the transformer model's performance for age and gender detection tasks. However, our approach yields noticeable performance increases for BiLSTM model. Additionally, we observe that the shuffling method serves as an effective means to augment training data, further enhancing models’ performance. Moreover, our shuffling-based approach enhances the models’ resistance to adversarial attacks in gender and occupation detection tasks without compromising their performance in age detection.}",2025,Online Social Networks and Media,"{author profiling,natural language processing,social media}",Computer Science,SS,24,"search engines, performance, open science, political science, 2021",1.0
From disruptive protests to disrupted news frames: Comparing German news on climate protests,"{This paper examines how news frames on disruptive climate protests differ from coverage of conventional protests in news outlets with different political leanings. Analyzing 6632 articles from 21 ideologically diverse German news sources between January 2022 and May 2023, we apply Word2Vec for semantic mapping, emotion classifiers, and qualitative evaluations to assess the frames present in the coverage of climate movements, and the anger attached to these frames. Comparing the more disruptive protests of the group “The Last Generation” and the more conventional protest movement “Fridays for Future”, we find that coverage of “Fridays for Future” varies predictably across the ideological spectrum: Right-wing outlets present protesters as extreme or criminal, while other outlets make reference to climate justice within their coverage of the protests, thereby following the movement’s own framing. When covering the more disruptive “Last Generation”, the entire news landscape engages in an emotionally-charged debate, asking whether the protesters are extremists or criminals, while barely discussing their actual demands. Amid an increasingly affectively polarized media debate on disruptive climate protests, left- and right-wing media remain divided in their evaluations of the protests, but focus on criminality and extremism rather than climate justice. The findings should serve as a reminder to journalists of their responsibility to carefully reflect the frames through which they cover protest movements.}",2025,Journalism,"{activism,climate protest,disruptive protest,framing,polarization,protest paradigm}",Arts and Humanities,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",1.0
A Comparative Evaluation of Quantification Methods,"{Quantification represents the problem of estimating the distribution of class labels on unseen data. It also represents a growing research field in supervised machine learning, for which a large variety of different algorithms has been proposed in recent years. However, a comprehensive empirical comparison of quantification methods that supports algorithm selection is not available yet. In this work, we close this research gap by conducting a thorough empirical performance comparison of 24 different quantification methods on in total more than 40 datasets, considering binary as well as multiclass quantification settings. We observe that no single algorithm generally outperforms all competitors, but identify a group of methods that perform best in the binary setting, including the threshold selection-based median sweep and TSMax methods, the DyS framework including the HDy method, Forman’s mixture model, and Friedman’s method. For the multiclass setting, we observe that a different, broad group of algorithms yields good performance, including the HDx method, the generalized probabilistic adjusted count, the readme method, the energy distance minimization method, the EM algorithm for quantification, and Friedman’s method. We also find that tuning the underlying classifiers has in most cases only a limited impact on the quantification performance. More generally, we find that the performance on multiclass quantification is inferior to the results obtained in the binary setting. Our results can guide practitioners who intend to apply quantification algorithms and help researchers identify opportunities for future research.}",2025,Journal of Machine Learning Research,"{class distribution estimation,comparative evaluation,prevalence estimation,quantification,supervised machine learning}",Computer Science,SS,28,"interviewing, performance, pretesting, machine learning, prevalence",1.0
Ambivalence across the globe: Investigating political ambivalence and its impact on vote switching in 52 multi-party systems,"{In many countries across the globe, the number of vote switchers is quite high. An under-researched dimension of this phenomenon is the impact of ambivalent political attitudes. Ambivalence describes the situation in which a person simultaneously has positive attitudes toward more than one political party or more than one political leader. Whilst the effects of party and leader ambivalence on vote switching have been investigated in the American political system, their application to multi-party systems is rare. This article aims to fill this gap. Before doing so, however, the article focuses on the development of party and leader ambivalent attitudes and system features of multi-party systems influencing ambivalence. For this research purpose, the article uses data from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems covering 195 elections in 52 multi-party systems between 1996 and 2020. The results, among others, demonstrate that ambivalence increases voters’ probability to switch parties between elections.}",2025,Party Politics,"{ambivalence,multi-party system,partisanship,political attitudes,vote switching}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Inflation of crisis coverage?

An analysis of crisis coverage in The Times (U.K., 1785-2020, 183,239 news stories) shows that the share of coverage that uses crisis keywords has increased, though not steadily. The number and salience of crisis news waves tied to discernible events has increased at a slower pace. The hypothesized driving forces - government expansion, mediatization of politics, and the activity of crisis frame sponsors - explain the development well and allow accurate predictions even when ignoring time in the forecasting model.

RESI: A COMPREHENSIVE BENCHMARK FOR REPRESENTATIONAL SIMILARITY MEASURES,"{Measuring the similarity of different representations of neural architectures is a fundamental task and an open research challenge for the machine learning community. This paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating representational similarity measures based on well-defined groundings of similarity.

The benchmark opens up several important avenues of research on representational similarity that enable novel explorations and applications of neural architectures. We demonstrate the utility of the ReSi benchmark by conducting experiments on various neural network architectures, real-world datasets, and similarity measures. All components of the benchmark are publicly available and thereby facilitate systematic reproduction and production of research results. The benchmark is extensible; future research can build on it and expand on it. We believe that the ReSi benchmark can serve as a sound platform catalyzing future research that aims to systematically evaluate existing and explore novel ways of comparing representations of neural architectures.}",2025,"13th International Conference on Learning Representations, ICLR 2025",,Social Sciences,SS,27,"family, network, italy, united states, correlation",1.0

Effects of Over-Time Exposure to Partisan Media and Coverage of Polarization on Perceived Polarization,"{America is said to be more polarized than ever before, and extensive research examines the causes and effects of political polarization. A less studied but more pronounced trend is that citizens perceive society and politics as sharply divided. We focus on news exposure as a key reason for these perceptions. We disentangle the unique effects of exposure to partisan outlets and to news coverage of polarization in general, whether in partisan or centrist news media. We rely on 9 months of online behavioral data (127,400,000 visits) from large samples in the U.S. and Poland (total N = 2,462 & 2,120), paired with a three-wave panel survey on participants' attitudes and perceptions. We measure individual exposure, over-time and unobtrusively, to partisan outlets as well as to news coverage of polarization through a fine-tuned BERT-based machine learning classifier. We find that both exposures increase perceived polarization, independently, in both countries. Yet, in both contexts, it is news coverage of polarization, regardless of whether it is ideologically left, right, or centrist news outlets, that is the strongest driver of perceived polarization. These changes are confined to personal-level polarization (perceived distance between oneself and members of the opposing party), while no measure significantly influences perceptions of society, more generally, as being polarized. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how the media’s increasing tendency to focus on conflict as a central reporting frame can be the driver of often exaggerated perceptions of partisan divisions.}",2025,Political Communication,"{computational social science,media coverage,partisan media,perceived polarization,web browsing data}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.0647710780425961

Plain language did not generally have a positive effect on data quality and questionnaire evaluation. However, in the plain-language condition, we found less item nonresponse and more response differentiation among respondents who spoke a language other than German at home, which suggests that especially respondents who likely have low literacy skills benefit from plain language.

"Conceptualizing, Assessing, and Improving the Quality of Digital Behavioral Data","{The spread of modern digital technologies, such as social media online platforms, digital marketplaces, smartphones, and wearables, is increasingly shifting social, political, economic, cultural, and physiological processes into the digital space. Social actors using these technologies (directly and indirectly) leave a multitude of digital traces in many areas of life that sum up an enormous amount of data about human behavior and attitudes. This new data type, which we refer to as “digital behavioral data” (DBD), encompasses digital observations of human and algorithmic behavior, which are, amongst others, recorded by online platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, or the World Wide Web) or sensors (e.g., smartphones, RFID sensors, satellites, or street view cameras). However, studying these social phenomena requires data that meets specific quality standards. While data quality frameworks—such as the Total Survey Error framework—have a long-standing tradition survey research, the scientific use of DBD introduces several entirely new challenges related to data quality. For example, most DBD are not generated for research purposes but are a side product of our daily activities. Hence, the data generation process is not based on elaborate research designs, which in turn may have profound implications for the validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of DBD. Furthermore, many forms of DBD lack well-established data models, measurement (error) theories, quality standards, and evaluation criteria. Therefore, this special issue addresses (i) the conceptualization of DBD quality, methodological innovations for its (ii) assessment, and (iii) improvement as well as their sophisticated empirical application.}",2025,Social Science Computer Review,"{data quality,designed data,digital behavioral data,error framework,found data}",Social Sciences,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",1.0
The role of networked governance for local climate policy output. Evidence from Europe,"{2020 was a crucial year for global climate policy. While the performance of national governments regarding their 2020 targets has been widely addressed in science and media, stocktaking of voluntary local targets remains opaque. This voluntary action by municipalities was developed in Europe as a complex system of multi-level and polycentric governance structures. ‘Climate intermediaries’ are meant to facilitate progress of local authorities in these complex network structures. There is little systematic evidence on the role of these structures for local climate policy output performance. This paper addresses this research gap. Based on a new dataset on local climate policy in more than 9000 local and regional entities across 36 European countries, it studies the effect of networked climate intermediaries on local climate policy output performance.

Contrary to our pre-registered hypotheses, we found no differences in meat selection, neither between the animal visualisation conditions compared to the control group, nor between the realistic and the schematic image condition. Moreover, we found no support for a mediating effect of cognitive dissonance.

From fear to support? The role of benefit guarantees in EU multilevel welfare governance,"{Recent transnational challenges have spurred calls for an enhanced European Union (EU) social agenda. However, citizens in countries with strong welfare systems fear that increased EU involvement could trigger a ‘race-to-the-bottom’ in benefits. This article examines whether these concerns can be mitigated by guaranteeing existing welfare standards. Using a vignette experiment in Belgium, the analysis explores public preferences for welfare governance within the EU multilevel system, conditional on safeguarding benefit levels. The findings show that, when benefit levels are guaranteed, support for the presented welfare policy is generally neutral to positive across governance levels. This suggests that fears of a ‘race-to-the-bottom’ can be alleviated when citizens are confident that welfare standards will be maintained. Despite hesitant endorsement of alternative governance arrangements, preference for the status quo persists.}",2025,European Union Politics,"{belgium,eu multilevel system,public preferences,welfare governance}",Social Sciences,SS,23,"european, governance, crises, attitudes, levels",1.0

How political and social constituent traits affect the responsiveness of legislators: A Comparative Field Experiment,"{A growing body of literature investigates whether legislators show biases in their constituency communication contingent upon constituent traits.

We address both issues using a pre-registered comparative field experiment conducted in Germany, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, in which fictitious citizens (varied by ethnicity, social class and partisan affiliation) inquired about legislators’ policy priorities regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Our pooled analysis reveals that co-partisanship and class both increase the responsiveness of legislators while we find no effect for ethnicity. The effect sizes we find are small, but comparable to earlier studies and also noteworthy in view of our hard test design. Our exploratory analyses further corroborate the lack of discrimination against ethnic minority constituents in showing no intersectionality effects, that is, interactions between ethnic-minority and low-class identities. This exploratory step also addresses the country specific differences that we find.

Using Live Video Interviews for Difficult Questionnaires on Social Networks,"{Collecting survey data via live video interviewing is a relatively new methodology, which received increased attention during the COVID-19 pandemic when contact restrictions and ethical considerations rendered face-to-face interviewing unfeasible. While many surveys switched from face-to-face interviews to online self-administration, this approach was unsuitable for complex questionnaires requiring interviewer assistance to guide respondents through the answering process.

This process involves respondents providing detailed information on their extensive social networks comprising twenty or more social contacts, including the elicitation of the network members, follow-up questions about those contacts, and questions about their relationships. Due to the high response burden, self-administration can lead to measurement errors such as underreporting network sizes or even respondent dropout. This study is the first to explore the use of live video interviewing for quantitative social network research by investigating three research questions related to nonresponse bias, participation motives, and interview experience. Leveraging a sample drawn from an established German probability panel, we compared a series of relevant measures between participants and nonparticipants at different stages of the participation process. We found significant differences in demographics (i.e., education), personality (i.e., conscientiousness), and attitudes toward surveys between these groups. The main motives for participation were the study’s purpose and topic. Notably, while both respondents and interviewers reported favorable interview experiences, the multi-step participation process, which required potential respondents to schedule an appointment for the interview, resulted in a response rate of only 16.8%. Together, our findings suggest that live video interviewing holds considerable promise as a survey administration mode for egocentric social network research and other applications. However, addressing the challenge of overcoming low response rates remains a priority in future methodological research.}",2025,International Journal of Market Research,"{complex questionnaires,egocentric social networks,interview evaluation,live video interviewing,motivation to participate,nonresponse bias}","Business, Management and Accounting",SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.013763126475431929
Scoring German Alternate Uses Items Applying Large Language Models,"{The alternate uses task (AUT) is the most popular measure when it comes to the assessment of creative potential. Since their implementation, AUT responses have been rated by humans, which is a laborious task and requires considerable resources. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in automatically scoring AUT responses in English as well as in other languages, but it is not clear which method works best for German data. Therefore, we investigated the performance of different LLMs for the automated scoring of German AUT responses. We compiled German data across five research groups including ~50,000 responses for 15 different alternate uses objects from eight lab and online survey studies (including ~2300 participants) to examine generalizability across datasets and assessment conditions. Following a pre-registered analysis plan, we compared the performance of two fine-tuned, multilingual LLM-based approaches [Cross-Lingual Alternate Uses Scoring (CLAUS) and the Open Creativity Scoring with Artificial Intelligence (OCSAI)] with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4) in scoring (a) the original German AUT responses and (b) the responses translated to English. We found that the LLM-based scorings were substantially correlated with human ratings, with higher relationships for OCSAI followed by GPT-4 and CLAUS. Response translation, however, had no consistent positive effect. We discuss the generalizability of the results across different items and studies and derive recommendations and future directions.}",2025,Journal of Intelligence,"{alternate uses task,assessment,automated scoring,creativity,divergent thinking,german,gpt,large language models}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.9047158767133212
On the Association of Attitudes Towards NATO and Weapon Deliveries for Ukraine with Vote Intentions in Germany,"{Studies have shown that foreign policy events can sway voting intentions. While initial analyses have explored Germany’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its foreign policy implications, public perspectives on this matter remain relatively unexplored, despite visible consequences like soaring energy and food prices, and concerns about escalating the war. To address this gap, the article delves into how Germans’ attitudes towards NATO’s role in the Russian invasion and the supply of weapons to Ukraine impact their voting intentions. Drawing on GLES data, our research reveals that rejecting further weapons deliveries significantly increases support for the radical-right AfD. Conversely, endorsement of such deliveries sees increased support for the Greens, FDP, and CDU/CSU. No significant effects are observed for the SPD and the Left Party. Notably, attitudes towards NATO and weapons play a role in the likelihood of supporting a new party associated with former Left Party politician, Sahra Wagenknecht. Crucially, these effects persist even when considering socio-demographic and ideological factors, underscoring the pivotal role of these issues in shaping party competition.}",2025,German Politics,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Improving Cross-Cultural Comparability of Measures on Gender and Age Stereotypes by Means of Piloting Methods,"{The study addresses the effects of piloting methods on the cross-cultural comparability and reliability of the measurement of gender and age stereotypes. We conducted a summative evaluation of expert reviews, cognitive pretests and web probing. We first piloted a gender role, an ageism, and a children stereotypes instrument in German and American English. We then randomly assigned the original and piloted versions to respondents in Germany and the United States using an online survey experiment and quota samples. No configural invariance was shown by the original instruments and the reliability of the gender role instrument was insufficiently low. The results show that piloting methods increased reliability and improved measurement invariance, although the effects varied by topic. Cross-cultural expert reviews and web probing provided more consistent results than other methods. A combination of web probing and cross-cultural expert reviews can maximize both reliability and measurement invariance.}",2025,Sociological Methods and Research,"{cognitive pretests,cross-cultural comparability,exact measurement invariance,expert review,reliability,web probing}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
"Science communicators, flat-eathers, or fitness coaches: who is citing scientific publications in youtube video descriptions?","{In this study, we undertake an extensive analysis of YouTube channels that reference research publications in their video descriptions, offering a unique insight into the intersection of digital media and academia. Our investigation focuses on identifying the actors behind YouTube channels that reference scholarly publications, and analyzing the types of content these actors share. Specifically we are interested in three principal aspects: the background of YouTube channel actors, their thematic focus, and the nature of their operational dynamics, specifically addressing whether they work individually or in groups. Our results highlight a strong emphasis on content related to science and engineering, as well as health, particularly in channels managed by individual researchers and academic institutions. However, there is a notable variation in the popularity of these channels, with professional YouTubers and commercial media entities often outperforming in terms of viewer engagement metrics like likes, comments, and views. This underscores the challenge academic channels face in attracting a wider audience. Further, we explore the role of academic actors on YouTube, scrutinizing their impact in disseminating research and the types of publications they reference. Despite a general inclination towards professional academic topics, these channels displayed a varied effectiveness in spotlighting highly cited research.

Introducing the Archive of Interwar Europe Election Data & Assemblies (AIEEDA),"{We describe the Archive of Interwar Europe Election Data and Assemblies (AIEEDA), a new multi-level dataset of parliamentary elections in interwar Europe (1919-1939). The data contains electoral results for all parties that ran in 137 national parliamentary elections in 25 interwar European democracies. It further offers detailed time-invariant ideological and organizational variables for 401 parliamentary parties and 35 party alliances, along with time-variant data on their participation in 412 cabinets. Next to national-level election results, we provide disaggregated constituency/municipality-level results for Estonia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia. Having collected national and disaggregated data independently, we validated each through the other. We also provide linking tables to parliamentary election results at the constituency/municipality-level for France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

"Polarization, fragmentation, and democratic deconsolidation in interwar Europe","{Around the world, democracy seems to be under threat. Polarization is considered a key culprit. In this study, we return the focus to ideological party system polarization, which we conceptualize as multidimensional, encompassing different policy dimensions. Theoretically, we argue that the effect of polarization on democracy is neither linear nor unconditional: Both high and low levels of polarization have deleterious consequences for democracy, particularly at low levels of fragmentation. When voters cannot meaningfully distinguish between government and opposition, democracies are as threatened as when political opponents represent fundamentally different ideologies. Finally, we introduce novel data on election outcomes and party positions in 25 European interwar democracies, an understudied period in which many Western democracies failed. Our observational analysis supports the predicted inverted U-curve relationship between ideological polarization and democracy, as well as its conditional nature on low party fragmentation.}",2025,Democratization,"{democratic deconsolidation,fragmentation,historical political science,multidimensional polarization,party systems,polarization}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.06380122733810352
A Comparative Evaluation of Quantification Methods,"{Quantification represents the problem of estimating the distribution of class labels on unseen data. It also represents a growing research field in supervised machine learning, for which a large variety of different algorithms has been proposed in recent years.

In this work, we close this research gap by conducting a thorough empirical performance comparison of 24 different quantification methods on in total more than 40 datasets, considering binary as well as multiclass quantification settings. We observe that no single algorithm generally outperforms all competitors, but identify a group of methods that perform best in the binary setting, including the threshold selection-based median sweep and TSMax methods, the DyS framework including the HDy method, Forman’s mixture model, and Friedman’s method. For the multiclass setting, we observe that a different, broad group of algorithms yields good performance, including the HDx method, the generalized probabilistic adjusted count, the readme method, the energy distance minimization method, the EM algorithm for quantification, and Friedman’s method. We also find that tuning the underlying classifiers has in most cases only a limited impact on the quantification performance. More generally, we find that the performance on multiclass quantification is inferior to the results obtained in the binary setting.

E-government and citizen-state relations: Evidence from a randomized information campaign with the Botswana Unified Revenue Service,"{E-government services are often heralded as a silver bullet for governments willing to engage more meaningfully with citizens. Evidence on the effectiveness of these measures for improving citizen-state relations is scarce, however. Most studies examining e-government focus on efficiency considerations; few consider potential effects on citizen-state relations. The present study analyses the effect of an information treatment about the availability of e-government services on citizen perceptions of government responsiveness. We conducted an experiment in cooperation with the Botswana Unified Revenue Service that randomly assigned registered taxpayers to receive a short message on their mobile phones. Our results indicate that the treatment has a significant, positive effect on the perception that the government addresses citizen needs, and more so for respondents with lower income. The findings suggest that, by affecting how citizens assess political realities, e-government can play an important role in shaping citizen-state relations.}",2025,Governance,,"Business, Management and Accounting",SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",0.01880412892143918
The simulation-cum-ROC approach: A new approach to generate tailored cutoffs for fit indices through simulation and ROC analysis,"{To evaluate model fit in structural equation modeling, researchers commonly compare fit indices against fixed cutoff values (e.g., CFI ≥.950). However, methodologists have cautioned against overgeneralizing cutoffs, highlighting that cutoffs permit valid judgments of model fit only in empirical settings similar to the simulation scenarios from which these cutoffs originate. This is because fit indices are not only sensitive to misspecification but are also susceptible to various model, estimation, and data characteristics. As a solution, methodologists have proposed four principal approaches to obtain so-called tailored cutoffs, which are generated specifically for a given setting. Here, we review these approaches. We find that none of these approaches provides guidelines on which fit index (out of all fit indices of interest) is best suited for evaluating whether the model fits the data in the setting of interest. Therefore, we propose a novel approach combining a Monte Carlo simulation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.

We find that 29% of TweetsKB and 23% of TweetsCOV19 tweets are deleted within a year of posting. Deleted tweets tend to express more negative sentiment than retained ones. In both datasets, polarized tweets show lower overall deletion rates, while tweets polarized along the science dimension are more likely to be deleted than politically polarized tweets.

Using Google Trends Data to Study High-Frequency Search Terms: Evidence for a Reliability-Frequency Continuum,"{Google Trends (GT) data are increasingly used in the social sciences and adjacent fields.

Our study adds to previous research by investigating a more comprehensive set of search terms and different aspects of reliability (e.g., differences in relative search volume distributions, correctly identified maxima). For this purpose, we collected samples of GT data for ten high- and two low-frequency search terms. We obtained one real-time sample and 62 non–realtime samples per search term (30 non–realtime samples for low-frequency search terms). Data collection was restricted to search data for Germany.

Qualitative analysis of these annotated sessions revealed nine distinct product search strategies, which participants often combined and applied at different stages of their search sessions. For each strategy, we describe similarities and differences between search and experience products and identify common strategy combinations across product types.

"To share or not to share–understanding individuals’ willingness to share biomarkers, sensor data, and medical records","{Technological advances in the recent past made it possible for researchers to collect and analyze large amounts of health data at unprecedented scale and speed. For example, fitness trackers and smartwatches produce steady flows of information on individuals’ health. Biomarker data and medical records allow to study individuals at new levels of granularity. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that access to such data for health research and evidence-based public policy decision-making is essential. However, having access to data depends on individuals’ willingness to share their data with others. In this paper, we analyze the factors that may affect the probability of individuals to share their biomarker, health, and sensor data using German survey data and a survey experimental vignette design. We study the impact of data type, recipient, and research purpose on respondents’ willingness to share their data as well as the effects of respondents’ own medical and data sharing history. Overall, participants’ willingness to share biomarker data was higher than the willingness to share other data types. Moreover, those who had shared data before were more willing to do so again. In addition, natural language processing analysis of textual responses capturing respondents’ motives to share their data shows that individuals do understand how valuable their data is for researchers. However, results also underscore that addressing concerns about the protection of data need to be taken seriously.

Mapping and Influencing the Political Ideology of Large Language Models using Synthetic Personas,"{The analysis of political biases in large language models (LLMs) has primarily examined these systems as single entities with fixed viewpoints. While various methods exist for measuring such biases, the impact of persona-based prompting on LLMs' political orientation remains unexplored. In this work we leverage PersonaHub, a collection of synthetic persona descriptions, to map the political distribution of persona-based prompted LLMs using the Political Compass Test (PCT). We then examine whether these initial compass distributions can be manipulated through explicit ideological prompting towards diametrically opposed political orientations: right-authoritarian and left-libertarian. Our experiments reveal that synthetic personas predominantly cluster in the left-libertarian quadrant, with models demonstrating varying degrees of responsiveness when prompted with explicit ideological descriptors. While all models demonstrate significant shifts towards right-authoritarian positions, they exhibit more limited shifts towards left-libertarian positions, suggesting an asymmetric response to ideological manipulation that may reflect inherent biases in model training.}",2025,WWW Companion 2025 - Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2025,"{llms,persona-based prompting,political bias,synthetic personas}",Computer Science,SS,1,"machine learning, large language models, llms, mining, errors",1.0
"Inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills: Differences across social categories and their intersections","{This paper explores inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills. We examine whether skills vary by gender, parental education, immigrant background, school track—and their intersections. In two samples of German adolescents (age 14–20y; N = 3162), we fielded the Behavioral, Emotional, and Self-Regulatory Skills Inventory (BESSI), enabling a fine-grained assessment of 32 skill facets from five domains. Analyses revealed skill advantages for youth whose parents completed academic education and youth without immigrant background across most skills. Gender and school track had more varied effects mostly in favor of girls and adolescents attending academic tracks. Inequalities tended to be most pronounced for Innovation Skills. Intersectional analyses suggested that skill inequalities across intersectional strata (i.e., combinations of social categories) arose primarily from main effects of social categories, rather than intersectional interactions. We conclude that inequalities in SEB skills are small but systematic and unfold primarily as main effects. Educational relevance and implications: Our research explored whether adolescents differ in their levels of social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills depending on their gender, immigrant background, parents' education, and school track. We found that parents' education and immigrant background were the factors generating most consistent inequalities in SEB skills, with skill advantages for adolescents whose parents completed academic education and autochthonous adolescents across all skill domains and most skill facets, especially in Innovation Skills (e.g., information processing, creative skill, abstract thinking skill). Gender differences and, to a lesser extent, differences by school track were also present but more varied in terms of which subgroup showed skill advantages: On most skills, girls showed skill advantages over boys (with the exception of Emotional Resilience), as did and adolescents attending an academic school track over those attending a vocational track. We further established that inequalities in SEB skills mainly arise from the simple effects of the social categories, rather than through complex interactions among their intersections. Our findings constitute a step towards helping educators, policymakers, and researchers identify groups of adolescents who are at a heightened need of support in developing SEB skills. This may help in developing targeted interventions and policies aimed at fostering equitable development of SEB skills in the future.

The Popularity Factor: A Comparative Investigation of Demand-Side Behavioral Personalization,"{Conventional wisdom is parliamentary elections have become more personalized. The idea of “leader-centeredness” pervades electoral politics, with leaders supposed to have a critical impact on election performance and popular leaders anticipated to yield significant electoral dividends, perhaps even more than party evaluations. While scholars agree leaders can and do matter to the vote, deliberations continue regarding the manifestation and extent of these effects. Using an original dataset inspired by popularity measures from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems project and incorporating data from up to 87 elections in 30 polities, this article provides the first consistent aggregate quantification of demand-side behavioral personalization, disentangling the distinct and mutual influences of leader and party popularity to the extent possible. It finds that a leader’s popularity directly correlates with party vote share and the likelihood of winning office, evidence of demand-side behavioral personalization. However, the effect of leader popularity on its own is consistently less potent than that of party popularity, providing an imperative nuance to the narrative regarding demand-side behavioral personalization.}",2025,Political Studies,"{behavioral personalization,cses,elections,leader-inclined voting,leaders}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.7247321060025926

Studying public attitudes to welfare state reform with survey research,"{This chapter investigates research on public attitudes toward the welfare state, building on Pierson’s seminal work on the New Politics of the Welfare State. Pierson posits that economic, demographic, and social pressures do not necessarily lead to welfare state retrenchment due to path dependence, which makes dismantling reforms unlikely and diminishes the influence of government ideology. A key element of this argument is the persistent high public support for the welfare state. This chapter begins with an overview of the main theoretical arguments, then shifts to an analysis of empirical findings, emphasizing methodological advancements. It concludes with a critical assessment of the progress made in studying the dynamics of welfare state reforms, particularly the role of public opinion in resisting reform pressures.}",2025,Handbook on Welfare State Reform,"{attitudes,reform pressures,survey research,welfare state}",,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.14411586641146928
Disambiguation of Implicit Scientific References on X,"{Scientific discourse on the social web has been shown to compromise the accuracy of scientific findings. Complex scientific claims are uttered in the form of short snippets with ""implicit references"" (seen as references to scientific publications where the URLs to the actual studies are never cited). This has led to uninformed online scientific debates on topics such as health pandemics or climate. To enhance social media content, we introduce in this paper the novel task of disambiguation of implicit scientific references, where the goal is to retrieve the original scientific publications implicitly referred to by social media users. We contribute the first formalization, ground-truth corpus, and baselines for the task. With this work, we aim at shaping an understanding of implicit references on social media, and at laying a foundation for developing and evaluating methods for the disambiguation of implicit references.}",2025,ACM HT 2025 - Proceedings of the 36th Conference on Hypertext and Social Media,"{dataset annotation,information retrieval,scientific references}",Computer Science,SS,20,"open science, social media, publications, training, retrieval",1.0
Adding Regularized Horseshoes to the Dynamics of Latent Variable Models,"{Dynamic latent variable models generally link units' positions on a latent dimension over time via random walks. Theoretically, these trajectories are often expected to resemble a mixture of periods of stability interrupted by moments of change. In these cases, a prior distribution such as the regularized horseshoe - that allows for both stasis and change - can prove a better theoretical and empirical fit for the underlying construct than other priors. Replicating Reuning, Kenwick, and Fariss (2019), we find that the regularized horseshoe performs better than the standard normal and the Student's t-distribution when modeling dynamic latent variable models. Overall, the use of the regularized horseshoe results in more accurate and precise estimates. More broadly, the regularized horseshoe is a promising prior for many similar applications.}",2025,Political Analysis,"{bayesian inference,item response theory,latent variable models}",Social Sciences,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",0.045815594359210905
PIAAC Survey of Adult Skills: A review of the research landscape,"{The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has transformed international research and policy debates on the assessment of adult skills. Although research using PIAAC data is accumulating, little is known about how these data are used and what they contribute to developing the various disciplines interested in adult skills. In this study, a data-driven approach was used to examine PIAAC-based international research to date. Drawing on a comprehensive analysis of 880 publications, the review found that the field of PIAAC research is young and geographically diverse, with dominant contributions from the United States and Germany. While PIAAC research relies on a broad pool of researchers with high collaboration rates, only a quarter of publications involve international collaboration. The analyses also revealed that the development of the field is based on four interrelated disciplines (education, sociology, psychology and economics) and three differentiated historical paths: theoretical and methodological approaches to the measurement of adult skills, cognitive skills and problem solving in technology-rich environments at the workplace, and the role of adult literacy skills for societal and economic development. Moreover, the PIAAC literature addresses a broad range of topics, including cognitive, non-cognitive and basic skills (e.g. literacy and numeracy), human capital, occupational mismatch, migration, “returns to skills”, informal learning and large-scale assessment methodologies. Implications for further development of PIAAC research for users of PIAAC data, data-providing institutions and policymakers are discussed.}",2025,International Review of Education,"{adult skills,bibliometrics,piaac,research review}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.5046241800590694
"Ready or not. National identity, vote choice, and mass media: Evidence from Germany","{Exploiting the increased prominence of debates on immigration, right-wing parties often frame and campaign against immigrants as a threat to national societies. Research on national identity has shown that these parties are particularly successful among voters with an ethnically charged, exclusionary conception of nation. National identity, however, tends to be rather latent and stable, while far-right voting is much more volatile. Explaining a temporal influence of national identity on political behavior, social-psychological theories argue that identities need to be activated to become behaviorally relevant. The main argument of this article is that the presence of immigration-related news in the mass media can serve as such a situational factor for thinking about the nation and thus increase its salience for electoral behavior. Combining individual-level panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study's Short-term Campaign Panel (GLES, 2019) with a measure of media salience of immigration-related news in news articles, this study is the first to examine whether national identity can be activated for political behavior through the salience of immigration-related issues in the mass media using panel data.}",2025,Political Psychology,"{identity activation,media salience,national identity,voting}",Psychology,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",1.0
Beyond time delays: how web scraping distorts measures of online news consumption,"{As the exploration of digital behavioral data revolutionizes communication research, understanding the nuances of data collection methodologies becomes increasingly pertinent. This study focuses on one prominent data collection approach, web scraping;specifically, its application in the growing field of research relying on web browsing data. We investigate discrepancies between content obtained directly during user interaction with a website (in-situ) and content scraped using the URLs of participants’ logged visits (ex-situ) with various time delays (0, 30, 60, and 90 days). We find substantial disparities between the methodologies, uncovering that errors are not uniformly distributed across news categories regardless of the classification method (domain, URL, or content analysis). These biases compromise the precision of measurements used in the existing literature. The ex-situ collection environment is the primary source of the discrepancies (~33.8%), while the time delays in the scraping process play a smaller role (adding ~6.5% points in 90 days). Our research emphasizes the need for data collection methods that capture web content directly in the user’s environment. However, acknowledging its complexities, we further explore strategies to mitigate biases in web-scraped browsing histories, offering recommendations for researchers who rely on this method and laying the groundwork for developing error-correction frameworks.}",2025,Communication Methods and Measures,,Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",1.0

We then randomly assigned the original and piloted versions to respondents in Germany and the United States using an online survey experiment and quota samples. No configural invariance was shown by the original instruments and the reliability of the gender role instrument was insufficiently low. The results show that piloting methods increased reliability and improved measurement invariance, although the effects varied by topic.

Facilitating the recall of biographical data: Alternatives to life history calendars,"{Reporting life course data is challenging for survey respondents since they need to search their memory for information. Traditional life history calendars where the interviewer guides the respondent through the process are not suitable for web surveys and are not displayable on smaller screens such as smartphones, which are increasingly used to participate in a web survey. Alternative instruments are required that utilize elements of life history calendars to collect life course data in self-administered surveys. To investigate which aspects of life history calendars that are both easy to implement for survey practitioners and easy to utilize for respondents have the potential to enhance the quality of life course data and are perceived as beneficial by respondents, I conducted a short web survey consisting of two waves conducted three months apart covering the respondents' occupational trajectory over the last two years. Herein I experimentally tested two simplified measures derived from life history calendars: (1) the graphical presentation of the time horizon by displaying information in a tabular format and (2) adding temporal bounding cues in terms of information about the respondents’ previous response behavior. The results show that providing the respondents with recall aids such as using a table format when collecting occupational data leads to better data quality compared to using question lists, even if respondents use their smartphones to complete the survey. Displaying information from previous surveys has the potential to help respondents retrieve biographical data but might as well lead to poorer data quality when respondents are not provided with the date of the previous survey.}",2025,Advances in Life Course Research,"{event history calendars,life course data,life histories,memory,survey methods,web surveys}",Social Sciences,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",1.0

CASMIN Versus ISCED: Validating Standard Education Variables for German Microdata,"{In German surveys, educational attainment is typically assessed through two questionnaire items: the highest general school-leaving qualification and the highest vocational qualification or higher education degree. These items are often combined into one variable for analysis, but there is no standard method for doing so. This hinders comparisons across publications and the aggregation of research data. This article presents the results of a large-scale validation of candidates for a German standard education variable based on the official International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) and the sociological Comparative Analysis of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations education scheme (CASMIN), both commonly used in Germany. Many survey datasets offer a derived ISCED variable that reflects the main ISCED levels; fewer offer CASMIN. The validation uses ALLBUS 2018 data and a data-driven selection of 157 validation variables. Candidate standard education variables that retain a higher relative partial explanatory power across validation variables in linear multiple regression models compared to the most detailed education variable are considered more valid. The results show that CASMIN-based candidates generally outperform ISCED-based candidates of the same number of categories. An ISCED-based variable performs better only when measured in a highly detailed fashion that accounts for the stratification of the German educational system. The commonly used aggregation into three broad education levels loses about half the explanatory power of the detailed variable. Research data centers are called upon to provide a CASMIN variable to data users, and researchers to use CASMIN rather than ISCED whenever possible.}",2025,Kolner Zeitschrift fur Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie,"{coding,data quality,measurement,sociodemographics,standardization,survey data}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
"Polarization, fragmentation, and democratic deconsolidation in interwar Europe","{Around the world, democracy seems to be under threat. Polarization is considered a key culprit. In this study, we return the focus to ideological party system polarization, which we conceptualize as multidimensional, encompassing different policy dimensions. Theoretically, we argue that the effect of polarization on democracy is neither linear nor unconditional: Both high and low levels of polarization have deleterious consequences for democracy, particularly at low levels of fragmentation. When voters cannot meaningfully distinguish between government and opposition, democracies are as threatened as when political opponents represent fundamentally different ideologies. Finally, we introduce novel data on election outcomes and party positions in 25 European interwar democracies, an understudied period in which many Western democracies failed. Our observational analysis supports the predicted inverted U-curve relationship between ideological polarization and democracy, as well as its conditional nature on low party fragmentation.}",2025,Democratization,"{democratic deconsolidation,fragmentation,historical political science,multidimensional polarization,party systems,polarization}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.06385073222709987

To fill this gap, we present a systematic review of the datasets for the automated detection of hateful communication introduced over the past decade, and unpack the quality of the datasets in terms of the identities that they embody: those of the targets of hateful communication that the data curators focused on, as well as those unintentionally included in the datasets. We find, overall, a skewed representation of selected target identities and mismatches between the targets that research conceptualizes and ultimately includes in datasets. Yet, by contextualizing these findings in the language and location of origin of the datasets, we highlight a positive trend towards the broadening and diversification of this research space.}",2025,Social Science Computer Review,"{data quality,hate targets,hateful online communication,multilinguality,systematic review}",Social Sciences,SS,5,"trust, learning, journalism, measurement, groups",0.5156880571228266

"The surge in living alone among young and middle-aged adults: A decomposition analysis of the rise in one-person households in Germany, 1991 to 2021","{BACKGROUND Worldwide, the number of people living in a one-person household (OPH) is rising, and young and middle-aged adults play an essential role in this trend. Germany has one of Europe’s highest rates of OPHs. Due to the country’s unique sociohistorical background, this paper looks at a 30-year period to examine how the increase in OPHs among 20–54-year-old men and women has developed since German reunification. METHODS We use data from the German Microcensus from 1991 to 2021 to calculate the annual share of individuals living in an OPH. Following an algebraic decomposition approach proposed by Evelyn Kitagawa and adapted by Glenn Firebaugh, we split the sample into 13 5-year birth cohorts to examine the effects of within-cohort change and cohort replacement in the rising share of OPHs. RESULTS After German reunification, the increase in OPHs was first driven by within-cohort change, most likely caused by different mechanisms in East and West Germany. Since the mid to late 2000s, cohort replacement has become the main force behind the increase in OPHs. West German women deviate from this in showing only a moderate rise in OPHs almost entirely driven by cohort replacement throughout the 30 years analysed here. CONTRIBUTION Considering East–West and gender differences extends our knowledge of how structural factors add to the increase in OPHs. Living alone is not merely the result of individual choices but also of sociohistorical circumstances. Future research must consider that a growing number of adults will have experienced an episode of living alone at least once in their lifetime.}",2025,Demographic Research,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
The level and development of university students’ social integration: personality traits and person-environment fit predict integration with fellow students and teaching staff,"{The transition from secondary to higher education can be challenging for students. They have to adjust academically and must integrate into a new social environment. Successful social integration is important for university students’ academic success and well-being. Previous studies illustrate that personality traits shape social behavior. However, research on the impact of personality traits on social integration in the university context is scarce. In this study, we investigate how students’ Big Five personality traits influence the level and development of their social integration. We analyze whether the fit of the students’ Big Five profile with their chosen major affects their social integration. We differentiate social integration with teaching staff and social integration with fellow students. We use the student cohort of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) for our analysis. We observed students for up to four academic years and estimated growth curve models with random intercept and random slope. The results show that all Big Five traits are significantly associated with both forms of social integration at the end of the first academic year, with the exception of extraversion and openness. While extraversion is only significant for social integration with fellow students, openness is only relevant for social integration with teaching staff. A poor person-environment fit regarding personality is significantly negatively linked to both forms of social integration at the end of the first academic year. However, the Big Five traits and person-environment fit affect the level of social integration only but not the development of social integration.}",2025,Higher Education,"{big five,person-environment fit,personality traits,social integration}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Antisemitism among Muslims in Germany,"{Antisemitism is a long-standing, yet recently escalating threat to Jews and social cohesion in general. While there are intense public debates on Muslim antisemitism, there is very little systematic research based on large-scale, representative data. We fill this gap by analysing approximately 8,500 respondents included in the German Integrationsbarometer 2020 survey. Our results demonstrate that antisemitism is significantly higher among Muslims compared to Christian or religiously unaffiliated respondents, and among immigrants from Turkey and the Middle East & North Africa compared to other groups. About 35 per cent of Muslims strongly agreed with classical antisemitic statements. Deeper analyses reveal that antisemitism is particularly high among Muslims who are very religious or less educated. On the other hand, antisemitism is much lower among Muslims who are less religious or highly educated. We find only limited support for the impact of the time since migration on the antisemitism levels of Muslims. The findings are robust to various operationalizations of classical antisemitism and modelling choices. We discuss the theoretical as well as political implications of our findings.}",2025,European Sociological Review,,Social Sciences,SS,19,"chapter, processes, germany, changes, political attitudes",0.5184515790567494
Forecasting Referendums: A Structural Model Predicting Adoption and Support in Irish Plebiscites 1968–2024,"{Election prediction flourishes among pollsters, the media, academics, and political anoraks, with four significant prognostic paradigms: opinion polls, markets, structural models, and hybrid approaches. Structural models, inspired by political science theory and based on so‐called “fundamental” indicators, have a long pedigree in predicting government performance in elections cross‐nationally. Despite their prevalence and prowess in forecasting contests for government, these structural models have not been applied to predict referendums, where the prognosis game, as far as it exists, primarily relies on polls. Perhaps this is unsurprising given that plebiscites can be especially hard to forecast given that citizens often vote on complex subjects not always salient in public discourse, partisan cues are sometimes lacking, and late opinion shifts are arguably more common than in elections. In this contribution, we break new ground by fusing two strands of political science literature—election forecasting and referendums—and devise a prediction model of plebiscites based on economic, institutional, and historical variables, thereby providing the first structural forecasting model to account for referendum adoption and support levels. We apply this model ex‐post to 42 national referendums in Ireland between 1968 and 2024 to test its applicability ex‐ante. In Europe, Ireland stands third only to Switzerland and Italy as polities that regularly employ referendums to decide public policy issues. With reasonable lead time, ex‐post estimates of our model offer solid predictions of the referendums’ outcome, with out‐of‐sample estimates calling the outcome correctly 68%–79% of the time, a remarkable feat given that the issues up for decision are varied. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model’s predictions are competitive with opinion poll estimates of these contests, illustrating that while our model is not a panacea, it provides a reasonable starting point for predicting the outcomes of referendums in Ireland and, importantly, plants a vital seed for future work on forecasting plebiscites using model approaches.}",2025,Politics and Governance,"{forecasting,ireland,referendums,structural models}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.13377551658777023

Creating Design Weights for a Panel Survey With Multiple Refreshment Samples: A General Discussion With an Application to a Probability-Based Mixed-Mode Panel,"{Panel surveys suffer from attrition, where participants drop out over time. To maintain generalizability, refreshment samples are frequently employed, bringing in new individuals, increasing the number of panelists, and balancing sample composition. Although refreshment samples offer numerous advantages, the inclusion of new panel members may introduce bias into the analysis if the design weights are not appropriately tailored to these new members and adjusted to align with existing panel members. If not correctly accounted for, their inclusion may bias results. This paper addresses the issue of designing proper weights by applying the multiple-frame weighting approach proposed by Kalton and Anderson, which is generally used for cross-sectional surveys, to ongoing panel studies with refreshment samples. We demonstrate its application to a synthetic data set and a probability-based mixed-mode panel with an initial sample and two refreshment samples. We compare estimates obtained using multiple-frame weighting with those obtained using unweighted and naively weighted methods (where design weights are used as calculated for the respective samples without adjusting for the fact that some members of the population have a chance of being sampled more than once due to the refreshments). These comparisons showcase the potential for bias introduced by neglecting proper weighting and underscore the importance of both a multiple-frame weighting approach and meticulous sample documentation.}",2025,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{gesis panel,inclusion probabilities,multiple-frame weighting,panel surveys,refreshment samples}",Computer Science,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",1.0

At the domain and facet level, the BESSI short forms showed patterns of associations with external criteria that were similar to the BESSI-192 and preserved most of the BESSI-192’s predictive power. The BESSI short forms also demonstrated full or partial measurement invariance between the primarily U.S.-based and German adult samples.

"Science communicators, flat-eathers, or fitness coaches: who is citing scientific publications in youtube video descriptions?","{In this study, we undertake an extensive analysis of YouTube channels that reference research publications in their video descriptions, offering a unique insight into the intersection of digital media and academia. Our investigation focuses on identifying the actors behind YouTube channels that reference scholarly publications, and analyzing the types of content these actors share. Specifically we are interested in three principal aspects: the background of YouTube channel actors, their thematic focus, and the nature of their operational dynamics, specifically addressing whether they work individually or in groups. Our results highlight a strong emphasis on content related to science and engineering, as well as health, particularly in channels managed by individual researchers and academic institutions. However, there is a notable variation in the popularity of these channels, with professional YouTubers and commercial media entities often outperforming in terms of viewer engagement metrics like likes, comments, and views. This underscores the challenge academic channels face in attracting a wider audience. Further, we explore the role of academic actors on YouTube, scrutinizing their impact in disseminating research and the types of publications they reference. Despite a general inclination towards professional academic topics, these channels displayed a varied effectiveness in spotlighting highly cited research. Often, they referenced a wide array of publications, indicating a diverse but not necessarily impact-focused approach to content selection.}",2025,Scientometrics,"{academic videos,altmetrics,social media metrics,youtube}",Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",0.20828553409652184
Measurement Quality of a Multi-item Scale in Plain Language,"{To ensure good measurement quality, survey questions should be clear, concise, and easily understandable for all respondents. One way of achieving this is to use plain language, an approach comprising a set of measures relating to the wording, sentence structure, and design of texts. Using a between-subjects design in a web survey, we tested whether a multi-item scale in plain language leads to better measurement quality while having similar scale properties to the original, standard language scale. Our results showed that the plain-language version led to greater response differentiation, fewer midpoint responses, and shorter response times than the original version, and that the two language versions had similar scale properties.}",2025,Field Methods,,Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.24330606719437886
"The Psychology of Attack Politics: Perceptions, Evaluations and Effects","{The Psychology of Attack Politics explores the use of political attacks in election campaigns, and the way in which their, often deliberate, use impacts voters and has wide reaching societal consequences. With most elections being fraught with tension, disrespectful treatment of political opponents, and political incivility, this timely book aims to disentangle the dynamics of how attack politics is perceived (e.g., whether citizens perceive a negative message to be, indeed, negative) and evaluated (i.e., whether citizens like or dislike attack politics). The book also looks at the effects of attack politics, for instance, whether exposure to negative or uncivil messages alters attitudes and behaviors, such as turnout, affective polarization, and support for political violence. The authors provide a systematic conceptualization of attack politics, made up of negativity, incivility, and intolerance. Focusing on cutting- edge research in political psychology, political communication, and electoral behavior, the authors make the central argument that to understand the effects of different forms of attack politics, there should be a strong focus on individual differences in message perception and evaluation. Exploring what ultimately drives the effects of negative, uncivil, and intolerant rhetoric, and analyzing the phenomena at the center of current scientific and public discourse, this is a fascinating reading for academics and students in psychology, political science, sociology, and communication, as well as anyone interested in political campaigning and elections.}",2025,"The Psychology of Attack Politics: Perceptions, Evaluations and Effects",,,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",0.5281543762098743
"Comparing the Accuracy of Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Estimates across Probability and Nonprobability Surveys with Population Benchmarks","{Previous studies have shown many instances where nonprobability surveys were not as accurate as probability surveys. However, because of their cost advantages, nonprobability surveys are widely used, and there is much debate over the appropriate settings for their use. To contribute to this debate, we evaluate the accuracy of nonprobability surveys by investigating the common claim that estimates of relationships are more robust to sample bias than means or proportions. We compare demographic, attitudinal, and behavioral variables across eight German probability and nonprobability surveys with demographic and political benchmarks from the microcensus and a high-quality, face-to-face survey. In the analyses, we compare three types of statistical inference: univariate estimates, bivariate Pearson’s r coefficients, and 24 different multiple regression models. The results indicate that in univariate comparisons, nonprobability surveys were clearly less accurate than probability surveys when compared with the population benchmarks. These differences in accuracy were smaller in the bivariate and the multivariate comparisons across surveys. In addition, the outcome of those comparisons largely depended on the variables included in the estimation. The observed sample differences are remarkable when considering that three nonprobability surveys were drawn from the same online panel. Adjusting the nonprobability surveys somewhat improved their accuracy.}",2025,Sociological Methodology,"{bias comparison,multiple regression coefficients,nonprobability surveys,probability surveys,survey error}",Social Sciences,SS,28,"interviewing, performance, pretesting, machine learning, prevalence",1.0
Enhancing autonomous vehicle acceptance with age and education sensitive simulation interventions: an experimental trial,"{The familiarity principle posits that acceptance increases with exposure, which has previously been shown with in vivo and simulated experiences with connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). We investigate the impact of a simulated video-based first-person drive on CAV acceptance, as well as the impact of information customization, with a particular focus on acceptance by older individuals and those with lower education. Findings from an online experiment with N = 799 German residents reveal that the simulated experience improved acceptance across response variables such as intention to use and ease of use, particularly among older individuals. However, the opportunity to customize navigation information decreased acceptance of older individuals and those with university degrees and increased acceptance for younger individuals and those with lower educational levels.}",2025,Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice,"{acceptance,autonomous vehicles,education,older adults,self-driving cars,simulated autonomous driving,transportation}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.5251749557971785
"Inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills: Differences across social categories and their intersections","{This paper explores inequalities in adolescents' social, emotional, and behavioral skills. We examine whether skills vary by gender, parental education, immigrant background, school track—and their intersections. In two samples of German adolescents (age 14–20y; N = 3162), we fielded the Behavioral, Emotional, and Self-Regulatory Skills Inventory (BESSI), enabling a fine-grained assessment of 32 skill facets from five domains. Analyses revealed skill advantages for youth whose parents completed academic education and youth without immigrant background across most skills. Gender and school track had more varied effects mostly in favor of girls and adolescents attending academic tracks. Inequalities tended to be most pronounced for Innovation Skills. Intersectional analyses suggested that skill inequalities across intersectional strata (i.e., combinations of social categories) arose primarily from main effects of social categories, rather than intersectional interactions. We conclude that inequalities in SEB skills are small but systematic and unfold primarily as main effects. Educational relevance and implications: Our research explored whether adolescents differ in their levels of social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills depending on their gender, immigrant background, parents' education, and school track. We found that parents' education and immigrant background were the factors generating most consistent inequalities in SEB skills, with skill advantages for adolescents whose parents completed academic education and autochthonous adolescents across all skill domains and most skill facets, especially in Innovation Skills (e.g., information processing, creative skill, abstract thinking skill). Gender differences and, to a lesser extent, differences by school track were also present but more varied in terms of which subgroup showed skill advantages: On most skills, girls showed skill advantages over boys (with the exception of Emotional Resilience), as did and adolescents attending an academic school track over those attending a vocational track. We further established that inequalities in SEB skills mainly arise from the simple effects of the social categories, rather than through complex interactions among their intersections. Our findings constitute a step towards helping educators, policymakers, and researchers identify groups of adolescents who are at a heightened need of support in developing SEB skills. This may help in developing targeted interventions and policies aimed at fostering equitable development of SEB skills in the future. Addressing these inequalities is essential for reducing educational gaps and enhancing the academic success and wellbeing of all students.}",2025,Learning and Individual Differences,"{bessi,inequality,intersectionality,maihda,non-cognitive skills}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.5281526806079889
E-government and citizen-state relations: Evidence from a randomized information campaign with the Botswana Unified Revenue Service,"{E-government services are often heralded as a silver bullet for governments willing to engage more meaningfully with citizens. Evidence on the effectiveness of these measures for improving citizen-state relations is scarce, however. Most studies examining e-government focus on efficiency considerations; few consider potential effects on citizen-state relations. The present study analyses the effect of an information treatment about the availability of e-government services on citizen perceptions of government responsiveness. We conducted an experiment in cooperation with the Botswana Unified Revenue Service that randomly assigned registered taxpayers to receive a short message on their mobile phones. Our results indicate that the treatment has a significant, positive effect on the perception that the government addresses citizen needs, and more so for respondents with lower income. The findings suggest that, by affecting how citizens assess political realities, e-government can play an important role in shaping citizen-state relations.}",2025,Governance,,Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",0.019811156250319862
The GRoNC: Guidelines for Reporting on Norm-Referenced and Criterion-Referenced Scores,"{Psychological test manuals vary widely in their reporting of the construction and interpretation of standardized scores. Consequently, the critical evaluation of norm quality and meaning is difficult for test users and reviewers. Because a specific standard for reporting on standardized scores is lacking, we developed Guidelines for Reporting on Norm-referenced and Criterion-referenced Scores (GRoNC), following a systematic approach for creating reporting guidelines (EQUATOR). The development took place in two stages: Stage 1, developing a preliminary version of the GRoNC based on a literature review; Stage 2, a Delphi process in two rounds, involving both theoretical experts (n = 11) and test developers (n = 14). The GRoNC includes a series of questions and associated explanations. It supports test developers in developing and reporting upon their standardized scores, and reviewers in evaluating a psychological test on its standardized scores. We provide recommendations on using the GRoNC and conclude by describing our expectations and plans to increase the impact of the GRoNC on reporting practice.}",2025,Assessment,"{assessment,psychological test,reporting standards,standardized scores,test interpretation}",Psychology,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.21352622611645614
"Risk–return preferences, gender inequalities and the moderating role of a counselling intervention on choice of major: evidence from a field and survey experiment","{In this study, we examine gender inequalities in educational decision-making. Specifically, we consider high school students selecting a higher education study programme and examine gender-specific risk and return preferences regarding monetary returns and the risk of failure in the programme. Moreover, we assess whether a counselling intervention can mitigate these gender inequalities. We employ a research design that combines a factorial survey and a field experiment to test our hypotheses. Consistent with our theoretical expectations, the results of the factorial survey confirm that girls are disproportionally deterred by the higher failure rates of possible study programmes, whereas boys are attracted more strongly by higher expected returns after graduation. Overall, the counselling intervention reduces the dissuasive effect of higher failure rates. Contrary to our expectations, the moderating effect is not stronger for girls but (if at all) is stronger for boys.}",2025,Higher Education,"{choice of major,factorial survey,gender inequality,intervention}",Social Sciences,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",0.6122988856906854
Associations between a multifaceted personality and academic performance in secondary school,"{Whereas meta-analytic evidence has accumulated about the important role personality characteristics such as the Big Five traits play for academic performance in secondary school, less is known about the specific behavioral and emotional repertoire that drives these associations. A closer look at the facet-level of Big Five traits can provide this knowledge helping to better understand why students differ in their success at school. We therefore studied associations between Big Five facets and academic performance (grades and standardized test scores in German and mathematics) in three independent secondary student samples (Study 1 N = 3866, Study 2 N = 2290, and Study 3 N = 366), using regression analytic, structural equation modeling, and meta-analytic procedures to test facet-level associations and incremental associations above traits. We found facet-differential associations with academic performance indicators, particularly for facets of conscientiousness, openness, and extraversion. Evidence for incremental effects of facets beyond traits was weak. Self-discipline (conscientiousness) was the only facet that consistently showed incremental effects across Samples 1 and 2. The results can stimulate research and practice to identify the underlying mechanisms that drive these associations and also highlight the specific emotional and behavioral repertoire that should be supported to help students to succeed in school.}",2025,European Journal of Personality,"{big five,grades and test scores,meta-analysis,personality traits and facets,secondary school}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
From fear to support? The role of benefit guarantees in EU multilevel welfare governance,"{Recent transnational challenges have spurred calls for an enhanced European Union (EU) social agenda. However, citizens in countries with strong welfare systems fear that increased EU involvement could trigger a ‘race-to-the-bottom’ in benefits. This article examines whether these concerns can be mitigated by guaranteeing existing welfare standards. Using a vignette experiment in Belgium, the analysis explores public preferences for welfare governance within the EU multilevel system, conditional on safeguarding benefit levels. The findings show that, when benefit levels are guaranteed, support for the presented welfare policy is generally neutral to positive across governance levels. This suggests that fears of a ‘race-to-the-bottom’ can be alleviated when citizens are confident that welfare standards will be maintained. Despite hesitant endorsement of alternative governance arrangements, preference for the status quo persists.}",2025,European Union Politics,"{belgium,eu multilevel system,public preferences,welfare governance}",Social Sciences,SS,23,"european, governance, crises, attitudes, levels",1.0
Gender Equality Plans and Inclusiveness in the European Research Area,"{Gender equality is a key objective of the European Research Area. The arsenal of gender equality concepts has expanded considerably over the past decades—from gender mainstreaming in the 1990s to the current inclusion, diversity, and intersectionality approaches. Gender equality plans (GEPs) are key to increasing gender equality. With the launch of Horizon Europe, the European Union’s research and innovation program 2021–2027, the European Commission introduced a new eligibility criterion: To be eligible, any research‐performing organization (RPO) applying for funding, except private companies, must have a GEP in place. There is little evidence on the prevalence of GEPs at RPOs, and if they incorporate concepts about inclusiveness, which is increasingly intended. To address this knowledge gap, we present the first results of a unique mixed‐method study that combines online survey data (N = 270) and web‐scraping data (N = 6,475). Almost half of the studied organizations (41%) have a GEP. Our results show differences for organization types, i.e., private companies are less likely to have one (6%). Moreover, the intersectionality approach (14%) is less frequently used in GEPs than inclusion (76%) and diversity (80%). Diversity as an approach is significantly more widespread in Northwestern Europe compared to Central Eastern and Southern European countries. Based on our study, we recommend that policymakers develop measures for private companies as well and call for further support to develop intersectional and inclusive approaches of GEPs in RPOs.}",2025,Social Inclusion,"{diversity,european research area,gender equality plans,horizon europe,inclusion,intersectionality}",Social Sciences,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",0.32616196312634477
The Effects of Open-Ended Probes on Closed Survey Questions in Web Surveys,"{Probes are follow-ups to survey questions used to gain insights on respondents’ understanding of and responses to these questions. They are usually administered as open-ended questions, primarily in the context of questionnaire pretesting. Due to the decreased cost of data collection for open-ended questions in web surveys, researchers have argued for embedding more open-ended probes in large-scale web surveys. However, there are concerns that this may cause reactivity and impact survey data. The study presents a randomized experiment in which identical survey questions were run with and without open-ended probes. Embedding open-ended probes resulted in higher levels of survey break off, as well as increased backtracking and answer changes to previous questions. In most cases, there was no impact of open-ended probes on the cognitive processing of and response to survey questions. Implications for embedding open-ended probes into web surveys are discussed.}",2025,Sociological Methods and Research,"{cognitive pretest,open-ended questions,reactivity,response quality,web probing}",Social Sciences,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",1.0

"Conceptualizing, Assessing, and Improving the Quality of Digital Behavioral Data","{The spread of modern digital technologies, such as social media online platforms, digital marketplaces, smartphones, and wearables, is increasingly shifting social, political, economic, cultural, and physiological processes into the digital space. Social actors using these technologies (directly and indirectly) leave a multitude of digital traces in many areas of life that sum up an enormous amount of data about human behavior and attitudes. This new data type, which we refer to as “digital behavioral data” (DBD), encompasses digital observations of human and algorithmic behavior, which are, amongst others, recorded by online platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, or the World Wide Web) or sensors (e.g., smartphones, RFID sensors, satellites, or street view cameras). However, studying these social phenomena requires data that meets specific quality standards. While data quality frameworks—such as the Total Survey Error framework—have a long-standing tradition survey research, the scientific use of DBD introduces several entirely new challenges related to data quality. For example, most DBD are not generated for research purposes but are a side product of our daily activities. Hence, the data generation process is not based on elaborate research designs, which in turn may have profound implications for the validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of DBD. Furthermore, many forms of DBD lack well-established data models, measurement (error) theories, quality standards, and evaluation criteria. Therefore, this special issue addresses (i) the conceptualization of DBD quality, methodological innovations for its (ii) assessment, and (iii) improvement as well as their sophisticated empirical application.}",2025,Social Science Computer Review,"{data quality,designed data,digital behavioral data,error framework,found data}",Computer Science,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",1.0
A Comparative Evaluation of Quantification Methods,"{Quantification represents the problem of estimating the distribution of class labels on unseen data. It also represents a growing research field in supervised machine learning, for which a large variety of different algorithms has been proposed in recent years. However, a comprehensive empirical comparison of quantification methods that supports algorithm selection is not available yet. In this work, we close this research gap by conducting a thorough empirical performance comparison of 24 different quantification methods on in total more than 40 datasets, considering binary as well as multiclass quantification settings. We observe that no single algorithm generally outperforms all competitors, but identify a group of methods that perform best in the binary setting, including the threshold selection-based median sweep and TSMax methods, the DyS framework including the HDy method, Forman’s mixture model, and Friedman’s method. For the multiclass setting, we observe that a different, broad group of algorithms yields good performance, including the HDx method, the generalized probabilistic adjusted count, the readme method, the energy distance minimization method, the EM algorithm for quantification, and Friedman’s method. We also find that tuning the underlying classifiers has in most cases only a limited impact on the quantification performance. More generally, we find that the performance on multiclass quantification is inferior to the results obtained in the binary setting. Our results can guide practitioners who intend to apply quantification algorithms and help researchers identify opportunities for future research.}",2025,Journal of Machine Learning Research,"{class distribution estimation,comparative evaluation,prevalence estimation,quantification,supervised machine learning}",Mathematics,SS,28,"interviewing, performance, pretesting, machine learning, prevalence",1.0
A Political History Forecast of Bloc Support in the 2025 German Federal Election,"{“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” said humorist and social critic Mark Twain. Simply put, history often follows recurring cycles, enabling us to identify patterns that will likely repeat. Such supposed steadiness should bode well for prediction. Nevertheless, regarding structural election forecasts, most projections rely on short-term political fundamentals measuring macroeconomic performance or government or leader popularity. In this contribution, we take a structural approach but eschew any macroeconomic or popularity measure and instead rely on historical and structural patterns to predict the 2025 German Federal Election. Using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR), our model predicts the vote share of Germany’s two largest blocs – the Union and the SPD – and All Others combined across 19 elections between 1953 and 2021 with solid accuracy (correctly predicting the winning bloc 3 out of 4 times), creating circumstances to assume Political History may be a helpful guide as to how the 2025 contest may pan out. Our ex-ante central projection for the 2025 German federal election foresees a cliffhanger race, with point estimates suggesting the Union and the SPD will win 26% of the vote each and All Others 48%, departing from the dominant narrative of the opinion polls of a clear CDU/CSU plurality vote victory and substantial losses for the SPD.

Good enough? A comparison of different harmonization procedures and their substantive consequences using the example of life satisfaction,"{Survey data harmonization can greatly improve the analytical potentials of survey data by making divergent measurements of the same construct comparable. While there may often be ideas on what is the optimal harmonization strategy (e.g. imputation or equipercentile equating), these approaches are not always feasible e.g. due to data-based restrictions or the lack of a suitable reference sample. Therefore, sometimes there is only a set of second-best strategies, such as linear equating or linear stretching, with no clear idea which of these should be given preference. The present paper takes this situation as a starting point and investigates the substantive consequences of different alternatives for a typical harmonization scenario using real-world survey data. Divergent substantive consequences are understood as differences in obtained analytical result patterns. Do the actual scientific conclusions differ when different harmonization approaches are employed? Results based on a variety of regression scenarios indicate that most substantive conclusions are obtained regardless of the harmonization approach chosen, but that harmonization procedures entailing an information loss due to recoding variables into smaller sets of categories should be avoided. Overall, this suggests that research based on sub-optimally harmonized scales can also yield valid scientific insights.}",2025,Quality and Quantity,"{equating,harmonization,life satisfaction,research data management,stretching}",Mathematics,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",0.31382711846671646

However, recent studies show that not all citizens punish governments for their undemocratic actions. In this article, we argue that citizens' understanding of and satisfaction with democracy are sources of heterogeneous reactions. In a survey experiment conducted in Germany and Poland, we show that the importance that citizens attach to specific institutions under threat, as well as their understanding of democracy, can explain much of the variance in citizens' responses to undemocratic actions. Citizens are willing to defend what they consider important for democracy - regardless of whether this reflects theoretical conceptions of democracy. Moreover, in times of democratic backsliding, Polish 'critical citizens', those who are dissatisfied with the way democracy works in Poland, are more likely to punish governments for undemocratic actions.

When do candidates “go negative”? A conjoint analysis to unpack the mechanisms of negative campaigning,"{Negative campaigning has become a prevalent campaign strategy not just in the U.S., but also in other established democracies. While negative campaigning has been a prominent focus of the academic literature, the state of knowledge is still mostly based on observational data, often artifacts of campaigning such as content analysis of press releases, campaign ads, or social media posts. Based on a pre-registered conjoint experiment embedded in surveys of more than 800 candidates running in German state elections, the paper aims to explain under what conditions candidates attack their opponents. Rational-choice considerations matter, as candidates are more likely to attack when they see a net gain in the strategy. However, the characteristics and behavior of the opponent also play an important role. Negative campaigning is more likely if the opponent is male, ideologically distant, and has attacked before. In contrast, the closeness of the race and the likelihood of retaliation have no influence on attack behavior. Furthermore, the decision to attack their opponent is largely independent of candidates’ own incumbency status, gender, or personality. By integrating relevant factors that were identified in the literature in one research design, the paper sheds light on the drivers of campaign negativity and points towards the role of further situational factors that are shaping candidates' behavior on the campaign trail. Beyond negative campaigning, this study demonstrates the value of embedding experimental designs in samples of political elites.}",2025,Electoral Studies,"{campaigning,candidate survey,conjoint experiment,german politics,negative campaigning,political elites}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.07798477229525014

Using Live Video Interviews for Difficult Questionnaires on Social Networks,"{Collecting survey data via live video interviewing is a relatively new methodology, which received increased attention during the COVID-19 pandemic when contact restrictions and ethical considerations rendered face-to-face interviewing unfeasible. While many surveys switched from face-to-face interviews to online self-administration, this approach was unsuitable for complex questionnaires requiring interviewer assistance to guide respondents through the answering process. Our study focuses on the collection of egocentric social network data as an example of such a challenging questionnaire. This process involves respondents providing detailed information on their extensive social networks comprising twenty or more social contacts, including the elicitation of the network members, follow-up questions about those contacts, and questions about their relationships. Due to the high response burden, self-administration can lead to measurement errors such as underreporting network sizes or even respondent dropout. This study is the first to explore the use of live video interviewing for quantitative social network research by investigating three research questions related to nonresponse bias, participation motives, and interview experience. Leveraging a sample drawn from an established German probability panel, we compared a series of relevant measures between participants and nonparticipants at different stages of the participation process. We found significant differences in demographics (i.e., education), personality (i.e., conscientiousness), and attitudes toward surveys between these groups. The main motives for participation were the study’s purpose and topic.

"The Psychology of Attack Politics: Perceptions, Evaluations and Effects","{The Psychology of Attack Politics explores the use of political attacks in election campaigns, and the way in which their, often deliberate, use impacts voters and has wide reaching societal consequences. With most elections being fraught with tension, disrespectful treatment of political opponents, and political incivility, this timely book aims to disentangle the dynamics of how attack politics is perceived (e.g., whether citizens perceive a negative message to be, indeed, negative) and evaluated (i.e., whether citizens like or dislike attack politics). The book also looks at the effects of attack politics, for instance, whether exposure to negative or uncivil messages alters attitudes and behaviors, such as turnout, affective polarization, and support for political violence. The authors provide a systematic conceptualization of attack politics, made up of negativity, incivility, and intolerance. Focusing on cutting- edge research in political psychology, political communication, and electoral behavior, the authors make the central argument that to understand the effects of different forms of attack politics, there should be a strong focus on individual differences in message perception and evaluation. Exploring what ultimately drives the effects of negative, uncivil, and intolerant rhetoric, and analyzing the phenomena at the center of current scientific and public discourse, this is a fascinating reading for academics and students in psychology, political science, sociology, and communication, as well as anyone interested in political campaigning and elections.}",2025,"The Psychology of Attack Politics: Perceptions, Evaluations and Effects",,,SS,16,"public opinion, driven, psychology, privacy, cross",0.6444533978930271
Digital communication and tie formation amongst freshmen students during and after the pandemic,"{This study examines the network evolution among sociology freshmen students during and after the Covid-19 pandemic as a natural experiment on the impacts of digitalised communication. The first surveyed cohort (N = 42) began their studies under lockdown in October 2020, when all classes were taught online (lockdown cohort). The second cohort (N = 66) started one year later when the lockdown measures were released partly and most classes were taught in a hybrid mode (hybrid cohort). We use Stochastic Actor-Oriented Models (SAOM) for model estimation; missing relations due to actor non-response are multiply imputed using SAOM-based procedures. The findings show (1) that the network among students of the lockdown cohort developed slower and reached a lower density at the end of the first term, (2) that the probability of triadic closure was significantly lower in the lockdown than in the hybrid cohort and (3) that in both cohorts, students have a stronger tendency to get acquainted if they share classes, but (4) that shared classes were more important for tie formation during lockdown. We conclude that digital communication will mitigate the opportunities to make new acquaintances and friends.}",2025,Social Networks,"{acquaintances,actor-oriented models,education,foci of activity,friendship,network evolution,pandemic,saom,students}",,SS,10,"covid 19 pandemic, trust, actor, social science, hybrid",0.4196382917335478

How geographic divides shape value orientations in Europe,"{This paper analyses how geographic divides in Europe relate to different value orientations. Based on previous research, we test which of three geographical divides—urban-rural, core-periphery, and between countries—best explains emancipatory and cosmopolitan value orientations. Using a novel ValCon dataset drawn from a May 2021 survey of six European countries, we demonstrate that the association between values and geographic divides varies by level. It is strong across countries, weaker for the urban-rural divide, and minimal at the core-periphery level. We also find that cosmopolitan value orientations are more strongly influenced by the urban-rural divide, while emancipatory values are primarily shaped by regional inequalities. Our findings highlight the context-dependence of value orientations and their association with intra-country geographic divides.}",2025,International Journal of Sociology,"{core-periphery,cosmopolitanism,cultural cleavage,emancipatory values,geographic divide,urban-rural conflict}",,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.05059765157704749
Adding Regularized Horseshoes to the Dynamics of Latent Variable Models,"{Dynamic latent variable models generally link units' positions on a latent dimension over time via random walks. Theoretically, these trajectories are often expected to resemble a mixture of periods of stability interrupted by moments of change. In these cases, a prior distribution such as the regularized horseshoe - that allows for both stasis and change - can prove a better theoretical and empirical fit for the underlying construct than other priors. Replicating Reuning, Kenwick, and Fariss (2019), we find that the regularized horseshoe performs better than the standard normal and the Student's t-distribution when modeling dynamic latent variable models. Overall, the use of the regularized horseshoe results in more accurate and precise estimates.

Gender Equality Plans and Inclusiveness in the European Research Area,"{Gender equality is a key objective of the European Research Area. The arsenal of gender equality concepts has expanded considerably over the past decades—from gender mainstreaming in the 1990s to the current inclusion, diversity, and intersectionality approaches. Gender equality plans (GEPs) are key to increasing gender equality. With the launch of Horizon Europe, the European Union’s research and innovation program 2021–2027, the European Commission introduced a new eligibility criterion: To be eligible, any research‐performing organization (RPO) applying for funding, except private companies, must have a GEP in place. There is little evidence on the prevalence of GEPs at RPOs, and if they incorporate concepts about inclusiveness, which is increasingly intended. To address this knowledge gap, we present the first results of a unique mixed‐method study that combines online survey data (N = 270) and web‐scraping data (N = 6,475). Almost half of the studied organizations (41%) have a GEP. Our results show differences for organization types, i.e., private companies are less likely to have one (6%). Moreover, the intersectionality approach (14%) is less frequently used in GEPs than inclusion (76%) and diversity (80%). Diversity as an approach is significantly more widespread in Northwestern Europe compared to Central Eastern and Southern European countries. Based on our study, we recommend that policymakers develop measures for private companies as well and call for further support to develop intersectional and inclusive approaches of GEPs in RPOs.}",2025,Social Inclusion,"{diversity,european research area,gender equality plans,horizon europe,inclusion,intersectionality}",Psychology,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",0.2657282682198612

Monitoring Attitudes Over Time: Real Change or the Result of Repeated Interviewing?,"{Panel data are often used to study change and stability in social patterns. However, repeated interviewing may affect respondents’ attitudes in a panel study by triggering reflection processes on the surveyed topics (cognitive stimulus hypothesis). Using data from a survey experiment within a probability-based and a nonprobability panel in Germany, we investigate change—and the mechanisms underlying change—in respondents’ abortion attitudes over six panel waves. The experiment manipulated the frequency of receiving identical attitude questions. We estimate multiple-group and longitudinal structural equation models to differentiate change in the measurement of abortion attitudes from “real” attitude change. Results show that repeatedly administering the same abortion questions increases the reliability of respondents’ reported attitudes and the stability of their latent attitudes toward abortion. However, we find no evidence of an increase in attitude certainty and knowledgeability on abortion and only tentative evidence of improved response behavior (increased attitude reliability) due to general survey experience.}",2025,Sociological Methods and Research,"{attitude change,cognitive stimulus hypothesis,nonprobability and probability-based panel studies,panel conditioning,structural equation modeling,“better respondents” model}",Social Sciences,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",0.024104390058842885
Global Profiles of Positive Youth Development: A Person-Oriented Analysis among Emerging Adults Living in 21 Countries,"{Although global research on the 5Cs model of Positive Youth Development (PYD; competence, confidence, connection, character, and caring) has expanded in recent years, there is a lack of understanding about distinct and consistent PYD profiles across youth from diverse socio-cultural contexts. To address this gap, this study utilized a person-oriented analytic approach to examine the PYD profiles of 11,481 emerging adults (Mage = 21.77; SDage = 2.74; 68.66% females) from 21 countries in four continents. Results of the multi-group latent profile analysis revealed four consistent profiles of PYD across countries: high/balanced (41%), self-efficacious (28%), socio-emotional (20%), and low/self-centered (11%). Participants’ age, gender, educational attainment, and country-level collectivism were also found to be associated with specific profiles. Older and more-educated females from less collectivistic countries were more likely to be in a high/balanced profile, while younger males from more collectivistic countries tend to be in a low/self-centered profile. Older and more-educated males from less collectivistic countries were more likely to be in a self-efficacious profile, while younger and less-educated females from more collectivistic countries tend to be in a socio-emotional profile. Controlling these socio-contextual covariates, the four profiles exhibited distinct relations with adaptive (resilience and contribution) and maladaptive outcomes (anxiety and adverse life experiences) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight the importance of fostering a balanced set of Cs, which include both self-efficacious and socio-emotional qualities, to promote positive adaptation in challenging times across diverse developmental settings.}",2025,Journal of Youth and Adolescence,"{5cs,emerging adulthood,multi-group latent profile analysis,person-oriented research,positive youth development}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.21119091038855933
A Political History Forecast of the 2024 US Congressional Elections,"{Statesman and scholar Alexis de Tocqueville (1876) once noted, History is a gallery of pictures in which there are few originals and many copies. In other words, history has a habit of repeating itself, and we can deduce cycles and patterns that likely will recur. Such stability and inertia should bode well for prediction. Nevertheless, when it comes to election forecasting, especially in the United States, most prognostications rely on short-term political fundamentals measuring macroeconomic performance or government or leader popularity. In this contribution, we adopt a structural approach but depart from existing literature by focusing on historical party and governance dynamics in the vein of de Tocqueville to establish whether they offer solid guidance regarding the performance of Democrats in US congressional elections. Our ex-post political history models provide solid predictions of which party will control Congress and the Democrats' seat tally in each chamber between 1946 and 2022. This creates conditions to assume that political history may help us forecast Campaign 2024. Our study applied this political history model to predict the 2024 congressional elections. It forecast Democrats to lose control of the Senate with a net loss of three seats and estimated an exceptionally close race for House control, with the point estimate for the House suggesting that the Democrats would fall short of winning control.}",2025,PS - Political Science and Politics,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.43958889833384934

The analysis examines the impact of ideological distance and perceived divergent issue positions between the candidates and their parties. In general, candidates show relatively high accuracy in perceiving their party’s issue positions. Furthermore, candidates who perceive a small distance on the left-right dimension to their party exhibit heightened accuracy, particularly on the immigration issue position. Moreover, candidates who perceive differences between themselves and their party have a more accurate perception of their party’s immigration issue position. These factors, however, do not affect the accuracy of candidates’ perception on social welfare issue position. The findings have important implications for the examination of political elites and public opinion.

"Conceptualizing, Assessing, and Improving the Quality of Digital Behavioral Data","{The spread of modern digital technologies, such as social media online platforms, digital marketplaces, smartphones, and wearables, is increasingly shifting social, political, economic, cultural, and physiological processes into the digital space. Social actors using these technologies (directly and indirectly) leave a multitude of digital traces in many areas of life that sum up an enormous amount of data about human behavior and attitudes. This new data type, which we refer to as “digital behavioral data” (DBD), encompasses digital observations of human and algorithmic behavior, which are, amongst others, recorded by online platforms (e.g., Google, Facebook, or the World Wide Web) or sensors (e.g., smartphones, RFID sensors, satellites, or street view cameras). However, studying these social phenomena requires data that meets specific quality standards. While data quality frameworks—such as the Total Survey Error framework—have a long-standing tradition survey research, the scientific use of DBD introduces several entirely new challenges related to data quality. For example, most DBD are not generated for research purposes but are a side product of our daily activities. Hence, the data generation process is not based on elaborate research designs, which in turn may have profound implications for the validity of the conclusions drawn from the analysis of DBD. Furthermore, many forms of DBD lack well-established data models, measurement (error) theories, quality standards, and evaluation criteria. Therefore, this special issue addresses (i) the conceptualization of DBD quality, methodological innovations for its (ii) assessment, and (iii) improvement as well as their sophisticated empirical application.}",2025,Social Science Computer Review,"{data quality,designed data,digital behavioral data,error framework,found data}",Social Sciences,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",1.0
One harmonization fits all?–Impact of missing population invariance on harmonization error when harmonizing social science survey questions with equating,"{When combining survey data from different sources, researchers face the problem that questions measuring the same construct often differ in their response scales across surveys, making data difficult to compare. In this situation, observed score equating in a random groups design (OSE-RG) can transform the data of one question into the format of another question, making the data comparable. However, OSE-RG transformations are population dependent. An OSE-RG transformation established in one population might not be applicable to other (sub-)populations. This leads to the problem that practitioners accidentally can introduce bias into subsequent analysis depending on how they harmonize and analyze their data. In this study, we empirically investigate this source of bias, termed (missing) population invariance of OSE-RG. We harmonize 16 question pairs from two general population surveys, finding that OSE-RG can be susceptible to missing population invariance. Based on the results, we provide recommendations on how practitioners can navigate the issue.}",2025,International Journal of Social Research Methodology,"{equating,harmonization error,linear stretching,population invariance,survey data harmonization}",,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",0.26840802733980035

"What Makes it into the Media? Party Messages, Communication Channels, and Media Outlets","{Media coverage of political actors and debates is a crucial avenue for voters to learn about political parties and their policies. However, nowadays party-media agenda-setting is increasingly shaped by large-scale transformations and the fragmentation of political communication across various party channels (e.g., press releases, social media, speeches) and media types (e.g., newspapers, television, online news), potentially affecting the provision of political information. This article examines these dynamics using large-scale textual data from political parties (n = 17,677) and media outlets (n = 90,531) published in the run-up to the Austrian national election in 2019. Building on the measurement of text similarity with state-of-the-art transformer-based models and multiverse analysis, we investigate the success of party messages from press releases, parliamentary speeches, Facebook and Twitter making it into important national newspapers, online news sites as well as television and radio news programs. The article shows that the variety in party channels and media outlets—with their distinct characteristics, modalities, and (technological) affordances—create different flows of information between the parties and the media. Press releases remain crucial tools for parties to get their messages into the media, while social media and parliamentary speeches also matter, albeit with varying effects by party. We also find that online news is more receptive to party messages than print, television, or radio news. Despite these differences, journalistic gate-keeping consistently favors large and government parties across all media types. These findings underscore the need for nuanced research into the interaction between party communication channels and media outlets in contemporary democracies.}",2025,International Journal of Press/Politics,"{agenda-setting,communication channels,news media,political parties,text-as-data}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.6021479686868845

Response Burden and Response Quality in Web Probing. An Experiment on the Effects of Probe Placement and Format,"{Probes are follow-up questions to survey questions used for question pretesting and evaluation. A probe can be placed concurrently-that is directly following the survey question it relates to-or retrospectively later or at the end of a survey. Retrospective probing ensures that the natural flow of the survey questions is not interrupted. In contrast, concurrent probing is argued to prioritize the quality of probe responses, as respondents can still access their short-term memory. To date, concerns that retrospective probe placement negatively impacts how probes are perceived and answered have not been tested experimentally. Recently, it has been suggested to employ “closed” probes with predefined response options, for instance using a check-all-that-apply format, also with the rationale of improving probe response quality. Closed probe formats suffer from fewer nonresponse and more themes being chosen than being typed in response to open-ended probes. The present research reports a study on the impact of probe placement on response burden and response quality of web probes. Moreover, it examines whether the effects of probe placement are moderated by probe format. Results show that respondents needed longer to recapitulate the survey question when probes are asked retrospectively and were less likely to offer interpretable probe response content for one of three examined probes. These effects were not moderated by probe format. However, respondents who answered open-ended probes retrospectively were more likely to rely on contextual cues from intermittent survey questions. This effect did not occur when respondents were presented probes with predefined response options. Implications for web probing design are discussed.}",2025,Survey Research Methods,"{cognitive pretesting,context effects,open-ended questions,question order effects,web surveys}",Social Sciences,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",1.0
From denial to window dressing? Resistance to gender equality plans at technical universities and the role of formalized implementation structures,"{The implementation of gender equality plans (GEPs) at universities provokes resistance from privileged groups. However, technical universities (TUs) in the European Research Area (ERA) are increasingly committed to developing and implementing GEPs. This study asks how institutionalized forms of resistance to GEPs in TUs interact with contextual factors–specifically, the level of formalization of implementation structures. In our qualitative content analysis of interview data from change agents and decision-makers at four TUs in the ERA, we theorize that implementation structures are crucial contextual factors to structure our data and interpret our findings on forms of resistance. We find that some forms of resistance are unrelated to the level of formalization of implementation structures, others are more prevalent in TUs with low-formalized implementation structures, and still others are predominant in TUs with high-formalized implementation structures. Our findings suggest that although a high level of formalization of implementation structures in TUs is associated with less denial of the existence of gender inequalities, resistance to GEP implementation persists but is more nuanced.

The base-rate and longer-term relevance of year-to-year change in personality traits,"{Personality traits are assumed to change slowly and incrementally. Recent intervention studies apparently challenge this assumption, showing that personality traits can also change quickly and substantially. However, how frequently do such quick changes manifest in the general population? This study sought to determine (1) a base rate of year-to-year changes in the general population and (2) the extent to which these shifts are related to longer-term change patterns. We examined year-to-year change in Big Five traits with nationally representative data from 7005 German participants, annually tracked for up to six years. Year-to-year patterns exhibited stability and change (e.g., ≥ 1 SD year-to-year change in ≈ 20%). Across participants, year-to-year trait score increases and decreases occurred in equal proportions, suggesting that in a given sample, year-to-year changes in different directions average out. Within participants, however, in all domains but agreeableness, year-to-year changes reliably propagated to longer-term trajectories. While much of the year-to-year change faded away in subsequent years, lasting shifts in individuals’ trait levels remained, particularly upon pronounced year-to-year decreases. Overall, (pronounced) year-to-year changes were relatively common, largely reversible, and yet predictive of individuals’ longer-term trajectories. We discuss how the results bridge set-point assumptions with assumptions of incremental trait change.}",2025,European Journal of Personality,"{big five personality,personality change,personality trait change,set-point model}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.5485991109301858
Numbers or Norms: What Predicts Gender-Based Violence in Higher Education?,"{Experiences of gender-based violence in the academic workplace negatively impact the well-being and careers of researchers. Higher education leadership often downplays incidents as singular events to signal the situation is not a crisis. About two in three staff experience violent behaviour, e.g. sexual harassment or psychological abuse since starting the current employment in higher education. Women and marginalised groups are more likely to experience gender-based violence compared to men. Drawing upon the data of an international large-scale prevalence survey, we find higher prevalence rates of sexual harassment in universities with a high proportion of women in leadership teams and significantly lower rates of psychological violence in universities in which staff support gender essentialist views. Taking our empirical findings and the concept of crisis as points of departure, we discuss the effects of women’s numerical representation in leadership and the support for gender essentialist norms on the disclosure of gender-based violence.}",2025,Palgrave Studies in Gender and Education,"{gender essentialism,gender-based violence,leadership,sexual harassment}",Social Sciences,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",0.8595729442779997
Rethinking political space in Europe: the modernisation and globalisation dimensions,"{This study challenges the conventional conceptualisation of political space in European countries as a two-dimensional socio-economic and socio-cultural structure. Utilising data from the 2024 European Election Study, it argues that no national political space is fully captured by these traditional axes. Instead, it introduces a novel framework based on two overarching socio-economic processes–globalisation and modernisation. The study identifies two core social dimensions that also include economic considerations: the modernisation dimension, which links traditional gender roles and opposition to same-sex marriage with attitudes toward climate change, often accompanied by support for wealth redistribution; and the globalisation dimension, which, although less uniform, consistently centres around immigration. These findings underscore the complexity of political conflict across EU countries and emphasise the role of party strategies, particularly those of far-right parties and mainstream party responses, in shaping voters’ political alignments.}",2025,Journal of European Public Policy,"{dimensionality,european elections,globalisation,modernisation,political space}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.08404779450354682
Family Integration and Social Contacts of People from Syria and Eritrea in Germany,"{To date, there has been little research on the extent to which the family integration of new immigrants influences the development of social contacts with people from the host society. There is the possibility that immigrants are less dependent on social exchange with people from the host society as soon as close family members live in Germany with them. Empirical evidence to date does indeed point in this direction, but it rests on a rather narrow foundation. Therefore, using data from the project Forced Migration and Transnational Family Arrangements—Eritrean and Syrian Refugees in Germany (TransFAR), we investigate how the family situation of refugees from Syria or Eritrea living in Germany influences the number of their extra-familial contacts. In contrast to previous studies, we explicitly distinguish between the number of extra-familial intraethnic persons and the number of extra-familial persons originating from Germany. Theoretically, we assume that the benefits resulting from relationships with persons of their own ethnicity should differ from the benefits resulting from relationships with persons originating from Germany. As a consequence, relationships with Germans should hardly replace family contacts, whereas relationships with co-ethnics should more easily substitute for family contacts. In fact, the empirical analyses indicate that family integration does not lead to refugees having fewer relationships with people from the host society, but instead fewer relationships with non-family people of their own ethnicity.}",2025,Kolner Zeitschrift fur Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie,"{family,migrants,networks,refugees,social integration}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.4304065692291378

Continuous Norming Approaches: A Systematic Review and Real Data Example,"{Norming of psychological tests is decisive for test score interpretation. However, conventional norming based on subgroups results either in biases or require very large samples to gather precise norms. Continuous norming methods, namely inferential, semi-parametric, and (simplified) parametric norming, propose to solve those issues. This article provides a systematic review of continuous norming. The review includes 121 publications with overall 189 studies. The main findings indicate that most studies used simplified parametric norming, not all studies considered essential distributional assumptions, and the evidence comparing different norming methods is inconclusive. In a real data example, using the standardization sample of the Need for Cognition-KIDS scale, we compared the precision of conventional, semi-parametric, and parametric norms. A hierarchy in terms of precision emerged with conventional norms being least precise, followed by semi-parametric norms, and parametric norms being most precise.

Online election campaigning in changing political environments: A comparison of the 2014 and 2019 European Parliament elections,"{It has long been assumed that social media would equalize election campaigning by providing cheap means of communication for smaller parties who lack a strong mass media presence. Yet given the increased political importance of social media, parties with more professional staff and resources could also gain the upper hand in online campaigns. So far, knowledge of the development of online campaigning in a rapidly changing political and technological landscape remains limited, as only few studies have taken a longitudinal and cross-country approach so far. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of more than 12,000 unique candidates from all 28 European Union (EU) member states in the 2014 and 2019 European Parliament (EP) elections. We theorize and empirically assess how party size and parties’ EU position relate to the presence, the activity and the salience of the EU among EP candidates on Twitter (now X). In the 2019 election, parties with a bigger national vote share and Europhile parties were more likely to be present and use Twitter more frequently to tweet about the EU.

Creating Design Weights for a Panel Survey With Multiple Refreshment Samples: A General Discussion With an Application to a Probability-Based Mixed-Mode Panel,"{Panel surveys suffer from attrition, where participants drop out over time. To maintain generalizability, refreshment samples are frequently employed, bringing in new individuals, increasing the number of panelists, and balancing sample composition. Although refreshment samples offer numerous advantages, the inclusion of new panel members may introduce bias into the analysis if the design weights are not appropriately tailored to these new members and adjusted to align with existing panel members. If not correctly accounted for, their inclusion may bias results. This paper addresses the issue of designing proper weights by applying the multiple-frame weighting approach proposed by Kalton and Anderson, which is generally used for cross-sectional surveys, to ongoing panel studies with refreshment samples. We demonstrate its application to a synthetic data set and a probability-based mixed-mode panel with an initial sample and two refreshment samples. We compare estimates obtained using multiple-frame weighting with those obtained using unweighted and naively weighted methods (where design weights are used as calculated for the respective samples without adjusting for the fact that some members of the population have a chance of being sampled more than once due to the refreshments). These comparisons showcase the potential for bias introduced by neglecting proper weighting and underscore the importance of both a multiple-frame weighting approach and meticulous sample documentation.}",2025,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{gesis panel,inclusion probabilities,multiple-frame weighting,panel surveys,refreshment samples}",Mathematics,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",1.0
"Ready or not. National identity, vote choice, and mass media: Evidence from Germany","{Exploiting the increased prominence of debates on immigration, right-wing parties often frame and campaign against immigrants as a threat to national societies. Research on national identity has shown that these parties are particularly successful among voters with an ethnically charged, exclusionary conception of nation. National identity, however, tends to be rather latent and stable, while far-right voting is much more volatile. Explaining a temporal influence of national identity on political behavior, social-psychological theories argue that identities need to be activated to become behaviorally relevant. The main argument of this article is that the presence of immigration-related news in the mass media can serve as such a situational factor for thinking about the nation and thus increase its salience for electoral behavior. Combining individual-level panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study's Short-term Campaign Panel (GLES, 2019) with a measure of media salience of immigration-related news in news articles, this study is the first to examine whether national identity can be activated for political behavior through the salience of immigration-related issues in the mass media using panel data.}",2025,Political Psychology,"{identity activation,media salience,national identity,voting}",Arts and Humanities,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",0.7210935058876276

Using the 2018 referendum to repeal the Irish ban on abortion, we test for mobilisation effects in which one campaign caused the withdrawal of support for its campaign and possibly motivated potential voters in the other side’s campaign. By remaining “on message” the pro‐choice side’s arguably less interesting campaign allowed mainstream elites to come on board. We offer evidence that the campaigns mobilized some groups and suppressed turnout in others, leading to a larger victory for the repeal (the ban on abortion) side than most had expected.}",2025,Politics and Governance,"{backfire effects,cleavages,electoral campaigns,minimal effects,referendums,turnout composition effects}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.12698211450119365
Conflict and support during apprenticeship training in Germany: consequences for apprenticeship success and further employment in the company,"{Dual vocational training, i.e., the combination of on-the-job training in a company and school-based teaching, is of major importance to a smooth transition into the labor market and for the recruitment of skilled labor in Germany. However, around 30 percent of all training contracts are not successfully completed and not all successful apprentices remain in their training company afterwards. Previous studies have shown that apprentices who terminated their training prematurely often report conflicts and insufficient support within the company as reasons. However, these studies do not include the group of successful apprentices for whom these two aspects might also have been an issue. Moreover, to our knowledge, no study has yet appropriately investigated how conflicts and a lack of support are related to the likelihood of staying in the training company as an employee after training graduation. Using panel data from the Starting Cohort 4 of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS SC4), we address these research gaps. Our results indicate that apprentices are less likely to finish their training successfully when they report conflicts in the company and more likely when they report support. Support does not buffer the negative effects of conflicts. Successful trainees are only less likely to subsequently remain in the training company when they report high levels of conflicts combined with low levels of support. Our detailed analyses suggest that this is rather due to missing employment offers from companies than due to graduates refusing these offers.}",2025,Empirical Research in Vocational Education and Training,"{conflict,labour market entry,school-to-work transition,success of apprenticeship training,support}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Mapping modern kinship networks: First results from the KINMATRIX survey,"{Objective: This study presents initial results from the KINMATRIX survey, a large-scale source of ego-centric network data offering an unprecedented level of scope and detail in mapping family relationships. Background: Research on kinship networks is limited by the scarcity of available data. As a result, key phenomena remain insufficiently understood, including the importance of extended kin, contrasts between kinship lines, and cross-national differences. Notably, extended kin provide a unique “strength in numbers” that can enhance social transmission, integration, and support. Method: We analyzed data from anchor respondents aged 25–35 (N = 11,788 anchors; 239,220 anchor-kin dyads) collected in seven Western countries (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States). Kinship networks included a large array of nuclear, extended, and complex kin (on average, 20 kin per anchor). We used descriptive methods to examine retrospective, current, and prospective assessments of kin ties across four measures: importance, closeness, contact, and support. Results: We report three main findings: First, extended kin are central to younger adults' lives, representing at least half of the family members they are emotionally close to, regularly contact, and deem important. Second, kinship networks are matrilineally tilted. Maternal kin are emotionally closer, more frequently contacted, considered more important, and more supportive. Third, cross-national comparisons reveal both similarities and notable differences, with the United States and Sweden showing elevated importance of extended and complex kin and Italy exhibiting higher social integration with nuclear and extended kin. Conclusion: Data on kinship networks can significantly advance our understanding of key family phenomena.}",2025,Journal of Marriage and Family,"{demography,family relations,family structure,family systems,intergenerational relationships}",Arts and Humanities,SS,27,"family, network, italy, united states, correlation",1.0

Intergenerational family life courses and wealth accumulation in Norway,"{While prior research has widely acknowledged the consequences of specific family transitions (e.g., parental death, parenthood, grandparenthood) for individual wealth holdings, the interplay of multiple family transitions and positions occurring at different life stages and in various orderings has received little attention. This is despite the fact that these transitions and positions most likely jointly shape wealth accumulation, both in the shorter and longer run. We apply (1) sequence analysis to identify typical family life course clusters defined by the timing of the death of the parent generation, the timing of the transition into parenthood, and grandparenthood and (2) regression analysis to describe how the accumulation of wealth between ages 40 and 64 differs by family life course cluster. Using Norwegian register data of individuals born in 1953 (N = 47,945), we identified six clusters of family trajectories ranging from childless individuals to individuals who were sandwiched between their parents, children, and grandchildren because of relatively early (grand)parenthood and late parental death. Individuals experiencing patterns with a later transition into (grand)parenthood occupied stable and high wealth positions over time. Individuals without children exhibited a steady increase in their wealth position. Additionally, experiencing parental death later in life was associated with increasing wealth, whereas early parental death was not. These results held net of gender and education. Pronounced and even increasing wealth differences over the life course seem to be associated with the interplay of multiple family transitions.}",2025,Social Forces,"{administrative register data,intergenerational transmission,sequence analysis,wealth inequality}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

The keys to the house - How wealth transfers stratify homeownership opportunities,"{This study investigates how actual and anticipated intergenerational wealth transfers – i.e., inter vivos gifts and inheritances – contribute to inequalities in the transition to homeownership by parental social class. Utilizing discrete-time survival analysis on data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (N = 13,018), we find that individuals whose parents were manual workers or service workers are less likely to become homeowners than those whose parents belonged to other social classes. Receiving inheritances or inter vivos gifts substantially increases the probability of homeownership, with the effect being most pronounced in the transfer year and diminishing rapidly thereafter. Anticipated future transfers also increase homeownership probability before transfer receipt. Together, anticipated and received transfers account for 15–54 % of the differences in homeownership transition rates by parental social class.

Monitoring Attitudes Over Time: Real Change or the Result of Repeated Interviewing?,"{Panel data are often used to study change and stability in social patterns. However, repeated interviewing may affect respondents’ attitudes in a panel study by triggering reflection processes on the surveyed topics (cognitive stimulus hypothesis). Using data from a survey experiment within a probability-based and a nonprobability panel in Germany, we investigate change—and the mechanisms underlying change—in respondents’ abortion attitudes over six panel waves. The experiment manipulated the frequency of receiving identical attitude questions. We estimate multiple-group and longitudinal structural equation models to differentiate change in the measurement of abortion attitudes from “real” attitude change. Results show that repeatedly administering the same abortion questions increases the reliability of respondents’ reported attitudes and the stability of their latent attitudes toward abortion. However, we find no evidence of an increase in attitude certainty and knowledgeability on abortion and only tentative evidence of improved response behavior (increased attitude reliability) due to general survey experience.}",2025,Sociological Methods and Research,"{attitude change,cognitive stimulus hypothesis,nonprobability and probability-based panel studies,panel conditioning,structural equation modeling,“better respondents” model}",Social Sciences,SS,7,"face, sampling, mixed mode, costs, web",0.02508475041438809
Digital communication and tie formation amongst freshmen students during and after the pandemic,"{This study examines the network evolution among sociology freshmen students during and after the Covid-19 pandemic as a natural experiment on the impacts of digitalised communication.

Location matters! Geospatial dynamics of MP responses to Covid-19 protests in multilevel systems,"{In liberal democracies, protest can serve as a trigger for necessary policy reforms, but it can also be used by a loud minority to advance political goals against the will of the majority. Focusing on such vocal protests in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, we investigate the following question: How does the location of protest events affect the likelihood of political engagement with the protests in a multilevel system? Combining social movement literature with studies of issue attention and rhetorical responsiveness, we analyze how German members of parliaments’ (MPs) responses vary using their tweets from the onset of the pandemic to the German federal election in September 2021. Using quantitative text analysis, we measure rhetorical responsiveness to Covid-19 protests and apply multilevel regression analyses and difference-in-differences. We find that more protests lead to more attention; however, MPs respond most strongly to protests within the state they represent. Furthermore, politicians’ level within the German multilevel system affects their attention to these protests, with MPs elected at lower levels of an electoral system responding more to local protest events than MPs elected at higher levels. The results highlight the importance of the location of protests in attracting political attention.}",2025,European Journal of Political Research,"{covid-19 protest,german politics,multilevel systems,rhetorical responsiveness,social media}",Social Sciences,SS,3,"political, multilevel, perception, germany, trust",0.37959739015721056
Creating Design Weights for a Panel Survey With Multiple Refreshment Samples: A General Discussion With an Application to a Probability-Based Mixed-Mode Panel,"{Panel surveys suffer from attrition, where participants drop out over time. To maintain generalizability, refreshment samples are frequently employed, bringing in new individuals, increasing the number of panelists, and balancing sample composition. Although refreshment samples offer numerous advantages, the inclusion of new panel members may introduce bias into the analysis if the design weights are not appropriately tailored to these new members and adjusted to align with existing panel members. If not correctly accounted for, their inclusion may bias results. This paper addresses the issue of designing proper weights by applying the multiple-frame weighting approach proposed by Kalton and Anderson, which is generally used for cross-sectional surveys, to ongoing panel studies with refreshment samples. We demonstrate its application to a synthetic data set and a probability-based mixed-mode panel with an initial sample and two refreshment samples. We compare estimates obtained using multiple-frame weighting with those obtained using unweighted and naively weighted methods (where design weights are used as calculated for the respective samples without adjusting for the fact that some members of the population have a chance of being sampled more than once due to the refreshments). These comparisons showcase the potential for bias introduced by neglecting proper weighting and underscore the importance of both a multiple-frame weighting approach and meticulous sample documentation.}",2025,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{gesis panel,inclusion probabilities,multiple-frame weighting,panel surveys,refreshment samples}",Mathematics,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",1.0
Assessing Data Quality in the Age of Digital Social Research: A Systematic Review,"{While survey data has long been the focus of quantitative social science analyses, observational and content data, although long-established, are gaining renewed attention; especially when this type of data is obtained by and for observing digital content and behavior. Today, digital technologies allow social scientists to track “everyday behavior” and to extract opinions from public discussions on online platforms. These new types of digital traces of human behavior, together with computational methods for analyzing them, have opened new avenues for analyzing, understanding, and addressing social science research questions. However, even the most innovative and extensive amounts of data are hollow if they are not of high quality. But what does data quality mean for modern social science data? To investigate this rather abstract question the present study focuses on four objectives. First, we provide researchers with a decision tree to identify appropriate data quality frameworks for a given use case. Second, we determine which data types and quality dimensions are already addressed in the existing frameworks. Third, we identify gaps with respect to different data types and data quality dimensions within the existing frameworks which need to be filled. And fourth, we provide a detailed literature overview for the intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives on data quality. By conducting a systematic literature review based on text mining methods, we identified and reviewed 58 data quality frameworks. In our decision tree, the three categories, namely, data type, the perspective it takes, and its level of granularity, help researchers to find appropriate data quality frameworks. We, furthermore, discovered gaps in the available frameworks with respect to visual and especially linked data and point out in our review that even famous frameworks might miss important aspects. The article ends with a critical discussion of the current state of the literature and potential future research avenues.}",2025,Social Science Computer Review,"{data quality,data quality concepts,data quality frameworks,measurement,representation,systematic review}",,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",1.0
An In-depth Analysis of the Linguistic Characteristics of Science Claims on the Web and their Impact on Fact-checking,"{Web claims, seen as assertions shared on the web and eligible for fact-checking, are at the heart of online discourse. They have been studied extensively on a variety of downstream tasks such as fact-checking, claim retrieval, bias detection, argument mining, or viewpoint discovery. On the other hand, claims originating from scientific publications have also been the subject of several downstream NLP tasks. However, research carried out so far has yet to focus on scientific web claims, which are scientific claims made on the web (e.g., on social media and news articles). The process of detecting and fact-checking a claim from the web can be very different depending on whether the claim is scientific or not, thus making it crucial for the developed datasets, methods, and models to make a distinction between the two. With this work, we aim at understanding what makes this distinction necessary, by understanding the linguistic differences between scientific and non-scientific claims on the web, and the impact those differences have on existing downstream tasks. To do so, we manually annotate 1,524 web claims from established benchmarks for fact-checking-related tasks, and we run statistical tests to analyze and compare the linguistic features of each group. We find that scientific claims on the web use more analytical speech, but also use more sentiment-related speech, more expressions of physical motion, and have distinct parts of speech (PoS) and punctuation styles. We also conduct experiments showing that BERT-based language models perform worse on scientific web claims by up to 17 F1 points for several downstream tasks. To understand why, we develop a novel methodology to map predictive tokens of language models to explainable linguistic features and find that language models fail to detect a specific subset of predictive features of scientific web claims. We conclude by stating that language models aimed at studying scientific web claims ought to be trained on scientific web discourse, as opposed to being trained only on generic web discourse or only on scientific text from scientific publications.}",2025,ACM Transactions on the Web,"{fact-checking,language models,nlp,scientific web claims,statistical analysis}",Computer Science,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",1.0
Non-binary experiences of (gender-based) violence at work,"{The experiences of non-binary people remain underexplored in HRM research. With limited knowledge and evidence, putting in place diversity management policies and practices is challenging. This article advances understandings of the experiences of non-binary people at work by providing empirical evidence from a survey conducted in 15 countries across Europe with nearly 18,000 staff at universities and research organisations, including 173 who identified as non-binary. Results suggest that non-binary people are more likely than other gender identity groups to feel socially excluded and unsafe at work, as well as more likely to be subjected to psychological violence and sexual harassment. The analysis shows that experiences of gender-based violence mediate the relationship between being non-binary and feeling socially excluded, unsafe or unwell at work. By integrating minority stress theory into the study of workplace inequalities, this research deepens the understanding of how systemic stigmatisation operates within gendered and binarist organisations. These findings emphasise the need to integrate considerations of gender-based violence into diversity management interventions and disrupt binary gender norms to ensure inclusion and safety at work. By advancing diversity, equality, and inclusion scholarship, this article provides actionable insights for HRM practitioners to address the unique challenges faced by non-binary employees.}",2025,International Journal of Human Resource Management,"{diversity management,gender-based violence,lgbt,non-binary,psychological violence,sexual harassment}","Business, Management and Accounting",SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",1.0
An Examination of the Role of Inverted Dark Tetrad Items on Structural Properties and Construct Validity,"{The use of inverted items is under vigorous debate in psychometric research. However, especially in the field of the Dark Tetrad - a compound of the aversive yet subclinical traits Machiavellianism, narcissism, psychopathy, and sadism -, the use of items in which high endorsement indicates low levels appears promising to obtain more information about low scores on the four traits. In this preregistered research (N = 500), we developed an alternative version of the Short Dark Tetrad (SD4) which - unlike the original SD4 - has a balanced set of regular and inverted items. Following the theory of utilizing inverted items, we demonstrate that more information (in the sense of item response theory) can be obtained from the newly devised Mixed SD4 (MSD4) as compared to the original SD4. Thereby, the scores of the MSD4 can be validly interpreted in the sense of the underlying traits' theories (i.e., construct validity), and the SD4 and the MSD4 yield highly similar nomological networks. We conclude that including inverted items is advantageous for the assessment of the Dark Tetrad. More generally, we present this case as a demonstration that balanced item sets are necessary to capture traits and behaviors exhaustively.}",2025,European Journal of Psychological Assessment,"{aversive traits,factor analysis,nomological network,reversed items,scale development}",Psychology,SS,14,"arguments, quality, mining, language model, artificial intelligence",0.3720085021163494
Between national trends and local realities: Spatializing energy vulnerability in 16 EU countries,"{Capturing energy poverty and its social and spatial inequalities is crucial for understanding the specific needs and effects of place-based energy policies. However, detailed EU cross-country comparisons are still scarce and do not account for the socio-spatial underpinnings of vulnerability to energy poverty. In this article, we construct a small-scale multidimensional energy vulnerability index based on 22 indicators spanning 16 countries from the European Union. Unlike previous EU-wide energy poverty indices, the proposed index captures the multifaceted nature of energy vulnerability using subindices on energy literacy, behavior, material conditions, and climate. We use PCA to combine theoretical and data-driven approaches for index creation. Additionally, we employ a geographically weighted approach that highlights the limitations of national trends compared with local realities. Case studies of Spain, the Netherlands, and Czechia help us map context-specific understandings of energy vulnerability. The vulnerability index presented in this paper constitutes a first attempt at measuring the small-scale socio-spatial nature of energy vulnerability in the EU. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering factors such as energy literacy, behavior, housing conditions, and health disparities in understanding energy injustice.

On the Association of Attitudes Towards NATO and Weapon Deliveries for Ukraine with Vote Intentions in Germany,"{Studies have shown that foreign policy events can sway voting intentions. While initial analyses have explored Germany’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its foreign policy implications, public perspectives on this matter remain relatively unexplored, despite visible consequences like soaring energy and food prices, and concerns about escalating the war. To address this gap, the article delves into how Germans’ attitudes towards NATO’s role in the Russian invasion and the supply of weapons to Ukraine impact their voting intentions. Drawing on GLES data, our research reveals that rejecting further weapons deliveries significantly increases support for the radical-right AfD. Conversely, endorsement of such deliveries sees increased support for the Greens, FDP, and CDU/CSU. No significant effects are observed for the SPD and the Left Party. Notably, attitudes towards NATO and weapons play a role in the likelihood of supporting a new party associated with former Left Party politician, Sahra Wagenknecht. Crucially, these effects persist even when considering socio-demographic and ideological factors, underscoring the pivotal role of these issues in shaping party competition.}",2025,German Politics,,Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

We find that 29% of TweetsKB and 23% of TweetsCOV19 tweets are deleted within a year of posting. Deleted tweets tend to express more negative sentiment than retained ones. In both datasets, polarized tweets show lower overall deletion rates, while tweets polarized along the science dimension are more likely to be deleted than politically polarized tweets. These findings reveal how deletion dynamics intersect with the structure of online debate, offering insights into the lifecycle of digital discourse and the impact of polarization on content persistence.}",2025,ACM HT 2025 - Proceedings of the 36th Conference on Hypertext and Social Media,"{covid-19,discourse analysis,online polarization,tweet deletion}",Computer Science,SS,26,"discourse, social media, polarization, scenarios, election",1.0
Surveying emigrants worldwide–using Facebook and Instagram to recruit respondents in cross-national (e)migration research,"{Sampling remains a major challenge when researching minority populations, especially in cross-national settings. While various sampling methods are established in the field, most of them cannot easily be implemented globally. However, worldwide operating Social Networking Sites provide an opportunity for the recruitment of certain hard-to-reach populations in almost all countries. Targeting German emigrants through paid advertisements on Facebook and Instagram, we aim to ascertain whether such ads could be used to recruit a nonprobability emigrant sample on a global scale. Specifically, we look at two aspects: relative cost efficiency and coverage. Using this approach, we achieved 3,816 completed surveys from emigrants in 148 countries and territories. The method also yielded good results in world regions where other surveys faced severe coverage issues. Furthermore, a considerable share of the sample could not have been reached using German population registers as a sampling frame, which otherwise constitutes the most promising alternative approach.}",2025,Comparative Migration Studies,"{emigrant research,german migration,global migration,meta sampling,migration research methods,survey research}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Using Live Video Interviews for Difficult Questionnaires on Social Networks,"{Collecting survey data via live video interviewing is a relatively new methodology, which received increased attention during the COVID-19 pandemic when contact restrictions and ethical considerations rendered face-to-face interviewing unfeasible. While many surveys switched from face-to-face interviews to online self-administration, this approach was unsuitable for complex questionnaires requiring interviewer assistance to guide respondents through the answering process. Our study focuses on the collection of egocentric social network data as an example of such a challenging questionnaire. This process involves respondents providing detailed information on their extensive social networks comprising twenty or more social contacts, including the elicitation of the network members, follow-up questions about those contacts, and questions about their relationships. Due to the high response burden, self-administration can lead to measurement errors such as underreporting network sizes or even respondent dropout. This study is the first to explore the use of live video interviewing for quantitative social network research by investigating three research questions related to nonresponse bias, participation motives, and interview experience. Leveraging a sample drawn from an established German probability panel, we compared a series of relevant measures between participants and nonparticipants at different stages of the participation process. We found significant differences in demographics (i.e., education), personality (i.e., conscientiousness), and attitudes toward surveys between these groups. The main motives for participation were the study’s purpose and topic. Notably, while both respondents and interviewers reported favorable interview experiences, the multi-step participation process, which required potential respondents to schedule an appointment for the interview, resulted in a response rate of only 16.8%. Together, our findings suggest that live video interviewing holds considerable promise as a survey administration mode for egocentric social network research and other applications. However, addressing the challenge of overcoming low response rates remains a priority in future methodological research.}",2025,International Journal of Market Research,"{complex questionnaires,egocentric social networks,interview evaluation,live video interviewing,motivation to participate,nonresponse bias}","Economics, Econometrics and Finance",SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.013720471042629563
Composition of core modules and item allocation in split questionnaire designs: impact on estimates from imputed data,"{An increasing number of social science surveys use split questionnaire designs to reduce questionnaire length, presenting only a subset of several questionnaire modules to each respondent while leaving out others. This approach results in large amounts of planned missing data that necessitates imputation. Research shows that imputation is most effective when each module covers various topics. Yet, single-topic modules may sometimes be preferable from a questionnaire-design perspective. A potential alternative from survey practice is using single-topic modules with an extended core module presented to all respondents that includes key items from all topics. This study investigates whether this strategy yields outcomes comparable to mixed-topic modules. Using Monte-Carlo simulations based on the German Internet Panel, we simulate split questionnaire designs, impute the missing data, and calculate estimates based on these data. Findings suggest that while an extended core module improves single-topic module outcomes, it is inferior to randomly allocated mixed-topic modules.}",2025,International Journal of Social Research Methodology,"{imputation,module construction,planned missing data,social surveys,split questionnaire design}",,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",1.0

COVID-19 Labor Market Protection and Support for the Welfare State: Job Retention Versus Job Loss in Four European Countries,"{The COVID-19 pandemic presents a natural setting to study how labor market protection policies may influence welfare attitudes because while lockdowns and economic recession threatened millions of jobs, job retention schemes shielded many workers from unemployment. We investigate support for unemployment protection and the unemployed among people active in the labor force and participating in the Mannheim Corona Study in Germany, Coping with COVID-19 in France, ResPOnsE in Italy, and the British Social Attitudes survey in Great Britain. Two-way fixed effects analyses on the German data show that there was a general increase in respondents' support over the onset of the pandemic and that while job loss significantly boosted support, there was little attitudinal difference between those who experienced job retention and those who continued working. We confirm these patterns with cross-sectional analyses in all four countries, providing comparative insight into attitudes across the largest European economies. Unemployment is materially similar to job retention, but because it is associated with higher support, we contend that nonmaterial factors such as risk perceptions may be consequential in influencing preference changes when individuals lose their jobs.}",2025,Social Policy and Administration,"{comparative analysis,covid-19,job retention,longitudinal analysis,unemployment,welfare attitudes}",Social Sciences,SS,23,"european, governance, crises, attitudes, levels",1.0
Beyond age and generations: How considering period effects reshapes our understanding of personality change.,"{Age, cohort, and period effects are three ways to explain personality trait change over time. While past research mostly focused on age differences, showing relatively consistent patterns, evidence for cohort differences is more mixed, and period differences have hardly been examined. However, age, period, and cohort are exactly collinear (age = period—cohort), such that estimates are likely confounded and always hinge on so-called identification assumptions. Identification assumptions shape substantive conclusions, and inappropriate or inconsistent strategies may explain past discrepant findings. To address this age–period–cohort identification problem in personality change, we leveraged four large-scale (Ntotal > 2 Mio) repeated cross-sectional data sets from 2003 to 2022. Our aims were to demonstrate how identification assumptions common in personality studies impact estimates for age, cohort, and period and to use weaker, substantively informed assumptions to narrow down the range of plausible solutions. Results showed that common identification strategies of constraining one temporal effect to zero can dramatically affect conclusions—less for age-graded, but more for generational differences. Using weaker assumptions, our results indicated that all three factors—age, cohort, and period—likely contribute to trait differences over time. Assuming age-graded change in a certain direction revealed cohort-related decreases in extraversion, openness, and neuroticism and increases in agreeableness, alongside period-related increases in extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness. This suggests that several previously assumed cohort differences may actually be driven by period effects, overlooked due to strong identification assumptions. Overall, highlighting the importance of appropriate identification strategies, our results offer unique insights into factors driving trait differences over time.

The educational wealth divide in Europe: Post-secondary enrollment gaps across parental wealth components and countries,"{Parental wealth is a crucial dimension of socioeconomic status (SES) and plays a significant role in the intergenerational transmission of educational advantage. Previous research on the topic has been limited to a small number of countries, and findings on the relationship between parental wealth and educational attainment are hardly comparable across institutional contexts. Furthermore, the specific role of different wealth components remains unclear. This study addresses these gaps by comparing parental wealth-based inequalities in post-secondary enrollment across 15 European countries, using harmonized Household Finance and Consumption Survey data. We assess how different dimensions of parental wealth – net, real, and financial – relate to children's post-secondary enrollment, and how these associations vary across institutional contexts. Our findings reveal substantial enrollment gaps between high- and low-wealth families in all countries, with these disparities remaining significant in ten countries even after accounting for other parental SES dimensions. When considering net wealth, we observe the largest enrollment gaps in Southern and Eastern Europe and smaller gaps in most Continental countries. However, most of country differences are not statistically significant. Real wealth, particularly housing assets, is the strongest predictor of enrollment, whereas the role of household debt is more context-dependent. These results underscore the importance of disaggregating wealth components and considering the specific national context when assessing wealth-related educational inequalities.}",2025,Research in Social Stratification and Mobility,"{educational attainment,europe,inequality,post-secondary enrollment,wealth}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.9062664699072978

Global Profiles of Positive Youth Development: A Person-Oriented Analysis among Emerging Adults Living in 21 Countries,"{Although global research on the 5Cs model of Positive Youth Development (PYD; competence, confidence, connection, character, and caring) has expanded in recent years, there is a lack of understanding about distinct and consistent PYD profiles across youth from diverse socio-cultural contexts. To address this gap, this study utilized a person-oriented analytic approach to examine the PYD profiles of 11,481 emerging adults (Mage = 21.77; SDage = 2.74; 68.66% females) from 21 countries in four continents. Results of the multi-group latent profile analysis revealed four consistent profiles of PYD across countries: high/balanced (41%), self-efficacious (28%), socio-emotional (20%), and low/self-centered (11%). Participants’ age, gender, educational attainment, and country-level collectivism were also found to be associated with specific profiles. Older and more-educated females from less collectivistic countries were more likely to be in a high/balanced profile, while younger males from more collectivistic countries tend to be in a low/self-centered profile.

COVID-19 Labor Market Protection and Support for the Welfare State: Job Retention Versus Job Loss in Four European Countries,"{The COVID-19 pandemic presents a natural setting to study how labor market protection policies may influence welfare attitudes because while lockdowns and economic recession threatened millions of jobs, job retention schemes shielded many workers from unemployment. We investigate support for unemployment protection and the unemployed among people active in the labor force and participating in the Mannheim Corona Study in Germany, Coping with COVID-19 in France, ResPOnsE in Italy, and the British Social Attitudes survey in Great Britain. Two-way fixed effects analyses on the German data show that there was a general increase in respondents' support over the onset of the pandemic and that while job loss significantly boosted support, there was little attitudinal difference between those who experienced job retention and those who continued working. We confirm these patterns with cross-sectional analyses in all four countries, providing comparative insight into attitudes across the largest European economies. Unemployment is materially similar to job retention, but because it is associated with higher support, we contend that nonmaterial factors such as risk perceptions may be consequential in influencing preference changes when individuals lose their jobs.}",2025,Social Policy and Administration,"{comparative analysis,covid-19,job retention,longitudinal analysis,unemployment,welfare attitudes}",Social Sciences,SS,23,"european, governance, crises, attitudes, levels",1.0
Instructed Response Item Attention Checks in Mixed-mode Questionnaires: Evidence from a Probability-based Mail and Online Panel,"{Mostly in web surveys, attention checks have been proposed to identify inattentive respondents in self-administered surveys as previous research has argued that low-quality answers may introduce severe biases in data analyses. The increasing popularity of mixing survey modes for conducting probability-based surveys amplifies the need for systematic research on the implementation of attention checks in these survey designs. Our study investigates whether an instructed response item (IRI) can be an adequate predictor of response quality in a self-administered mixed-mode panel survey with a probability-based German general population sample. By doing so, we compare the results of the attention check with those of other response quality indicators. However, while the results for the online respondents were somewhat promising, the mail respondents result suggests that this response quality indicator seems unreliable, so that we cannot recommend using IRIs in general population mixed-mode surveys, which include a mail option.}",2025,Field Methods,,Social Sciences,SS,15,"closed, quality, pretesting, coding, interviewing",1.0

Do they have no other choice?

Studies have found a complex relationship between conservative values and right-wing populist voting; some studies have found positive associations, while others have found negative ones. This study aims to investigate the relationship between conservative values captured by higher-order value conservation in Schwartz’s theory of basic human values and voting for right-wing populist parties by examining the role of the liberal versus authoritarian composition of the party landscape as a moderating factor. Using data from the European Social Survey and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey, the study employs multilevel multinomial regression models to analyse this relationship. The results indicate that the likelihood of right-wing populist voting or not voting (as another possible alternative to voting for conservative parties) increases for individuals with a higher priority for conservative values in more liberal party landscapes, defined as the sum of all ideological positions of relevant political parties on economic and social policies.

"To share or not to share–understanding individuals’ willingness to share biomarkers, sensor data, and medical records","{Technological advances in the recent past made it possible for researchers to collect and analyze large amounts of health data at unprecedented scale and speed. For example, fitness trackers and smartwatches produce steady flows of information on individuals’ health. Biomarker data and medical records allow to study individuals at new levels of granularity. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted that access to such data for health research and evidence-based public policy decision-making is essential. However, having access to data depends on individuals’ willingness to share their data with others. In this paper, we analyze the factors that may affect the probability of individuals to share their biomarker, health, and sensor data using German survey data and a survey experimental vignette design. We study the impact of data type, recipient, and research purpose on respondents’ willingness to share their data as well as the effects of respondents’ own medical and data sharing history. Overall, participants’ willingness to share biomarker data was higher than the willingness to share other data types. Moreover, those who had shared data before were more willing to do so again. In addition, natural language processing analysis of textual responses capturing respondents’ motives to share their data shows that individuals do understand how valuable their data is for researchers. However, results also underscore that addressing concerns about the protection of data need to be taken seriously.

Good enough? A comparison of different harmonization procedures and their substantive consequences using the example of life satisfaction,"{Survey data harmonization can greatly improve the analytical potentials of survey data by making divergent measurements of the same construct comparable. While there may often be ideas on what is the optimal harmonization strategy (e.g. imputation or equipercentile equating), these approaches are not always feasible e.g. due to data-based restrictions or the lack of a suitable reference sample. Therefore, sometimes there is only a set of second-best strategies, such as linear equating or linear stretching, with no clear idea which of these should be given preference. The present paper takes this situation as a starting point and investigates the substantive consequences of different alternatives for a typical harmonization scenario using real-world survey data. Divergent substantive consequences are understood as differences in obtained analytical result patterns. Do the actual scientific conclusions differ when different harmonization approaches are employed? Results based on a variety of regression scenarios indicate that most substantive conclusions are obtained regardless of the harmonization approach chosen, but that harmonization procedures entailing an information loss due to recoding variables into smaller sets of categories should be avoided. Overall, this suggests that research based on sub-optimally harmonized scales can also yield valid scientific insights.}",2025,Quality and Quantity,"{equating,harmonization,life satisfaction,research data management,stretching}",,SS,11,"comparability, big, governance, personality traits, level",0.26643549775819053
Creating Design Weights for a Panel Survey With Multiple Refreshment Samples: A General Discussion With an Application to a Probability-Based Mixed-Mode Panel,"{Panel surveys suffer from attrition, where participants drop out over time. To maintain generalizability, refreshment samples are frequently employed, bringing in new individuals, increasing the number of panelists, and balancing sample composition. Although refreshment samples offer numerous advantages, the inclusion of new panel members may introduce bias into the analysis if the design weights are not appropriately tailored to these new members and adjusted to align with existing panel members. If not correctly accounted for, their inclusion may bias results. This paper addresses the issue of designing proper weights by applying the multiple-frame weighting approach proposed by Kalton and Anderson, which is generally used for cross-sectional surveys, to ongoing panel studies with refreshment samples. We demonstrate its application to a synthetic data set and a probability-based mixed-mode panel with an initial sample and two refreshment samples. We compare estimates obtained using multiple-frame weighting with those obtained using unweighted and naively weighted methods (where design weights are used as calculated for the respective samples without adjusting for the fact that some members of the population have a chance of being sampled more than once due to the refreshments). These comparisons showcase the potential for bias introduced by neglecting proper weighting and underscore the importance of both a multiple-frame weighting approach and meticulous sample documentation.}",2025,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{gesis panel,inclusion probabilities,multiple-frame weighting,panel surveys,refreshment samples}",Psychology,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",1.0

Using the 2018 referendum to repeal the Irish ban on abortion, we test for mobilisation effects in which one campaign caused the withdrawal of support for its campaign and possibly motivated potential voters in the other side’s campaign. By remaining “on message” the pro‐choice side’s arguably less interesting campaign allowed mainstream elites to come on board.

We test our theoretical assumptions using candidate surveys for twelve state elections in Germany with more than 3,100 candidates. Our results strongly suggest that negative campaigning goes beyond rational considerations.

The keys to the house - How wealth transfers stratify homeownership opportunities,"{This study investigates how actual and anticipated intergenerational wealth transfers – i.e., inter vivos gifts and inheritances – contribute to inequalities in the transition to homeownership by parental social class. Utilizing discrete-time survival analysis on data from the German Socioeconomic Panel Study (N = 13,018), we find that individuals whose parents were manual workers or service workers are less likely to become homeowners than those whose parents belonged to other social classes. Receiving inheritances or inter vivos gifts substantially increases the probability of homeownership, with the effect being most pronounced in the transfer year and diminishing rapidly thereafter. Anticipated future transfers also increase homeownership probability before transfer receipt. Together, anticipated and received transfers account for 15–54 % of the differences in homeownership transition rates by parental social class. Ignoring expected transfers leads to a significant underestimation of the role that wealth plays in shaping the relationship between parental class and homeownership. However, for most class contrasts, other mediators— such as respondents’ social class, income, and family status— explain a larger share of the differences than wealth transfers.}",2025,Social Science Research,"{homeownership,inheritance,intergenerational transfers,social stratification}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0

Non-binary experiences of (gender-based) violence at work,"{The experiences of non-binary people remain underexplored in HRM research.

This article advances understandings of the experiences of non-binary people at work by providing empirical evidence from a survey conducted in 15 countries across Europe with nearly 18,000 staff at universities and research organisations, including 173 who identified as non-binary. Results suggest that non-binary people are more likely than other gender identity groups to feel socially excluded and unsafe at work, as well as more likely to be subjected to psychological violence and sexual harassment. The analysis shows that experiences of gender-based violence mediate the relationship between being non-binary and feeling socially excluded, unsafe or unwell at work. By integrating minority stress theory into the study of workplace inequalities, this research deepens the understanding of how systemic stigmatisation operates within gendered and binarist organisations.

We conducted an experiment in cooperation with the Botswana Unified Revenue Service that randomly assigned registered taxpayers to receive a short message on their mobile phones. Our results indicate that the treatment has a significant, positive effect on the perception that the government addresses citizen needs, and more so for respondents with lower income. The findings suggest that, by affecting how citizens assess political realities, e-government can play an important role in shaping citizen-state relations.}",2025,Governance,,Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",0.019335593429184405
Leveraging Large Language Models for Dataset Discovery,"{The exponential growth of data across diverse domains highlights the need for efficient methods in discovering relevant datasets. Traditional search engines such as Google have served as the go-to tools for this purpose. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot have sparked interest in their potential to serve as alternatives for data discovery. While these models are primarily designed for conversational interactions, their capabilities in information retrieval and dataset discovery are becoming areas of active exploration. In this work, we present a mixed-method study that investigates the difference in user experience when using Google and Microsoft Copilot to search for datasets.

Scoring German Alternate Uses Items Applying Large Language Models,"{The alternate uses task (AUT) is the most popular measure when it comes to the assessment of creative potential. Since their implementation, AUT responses have been rated by humans, which is a laborious task and requires considerable resources. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in automatically scoring AUT responses in English as well as in other languages, but it is not clear which method works best for German data. Therefore, we investigated the performance of different LLMs for the automated scoring of German AUT responses. We compiled German data across five research groups including ~50,000 responses for 15 different alternate uses objects from eight lab and online survey studies (including ~2300 participants) to examine generalizability across datasets and assessment conditions. Following a pre-registered analysis plan, we compared the performance of two fine-tuned, multilingual LLM-based approaches [Cross-Lingual Alternate Uses Scoring (CLAUS) and the Open Creativity Scoring with Artificial Intelligence (OCSAI)] with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4) in scoring (a) the original German AUT responses and (b) the responses translated to English. We found that the LLM-based scorings were substantially correlated with human ratings, with higher relationships for OCSAI followed by GPT-4 and CLAUS. Response translation, however, had no consistent positive effect. We discuss the generalizability of the results across different items and studies and derive recommendations and future directions.}",2025,Journal of Intelligence,"{alternate uses task,assessment,automated scoring,creativity,divergent thinking,german,gpt,large language models}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.9548201461016964

Effects of Over-Time Exposure to Partisan Media and Coverage of Polarization on Perceived Polarization,"{America is said to be more polarized than ever before, and extensive research examines the causes and effects of political polarization. A less studied but more pronounced trend is that citizens perceive society and politics as sharply divided. We focus on news exposure as a key reason for these perceptions. We disentangle the unique effects of exposure to partisan outlets and to news coverage of polarization in general, whether in partisan or centrist news media. We rely on 9 months of online behavioral data (127,400,000 visits) from large samples in the U.S. and Poland (total N = 2,462 & 2,120), paired with a three-wave panel survey on participants' attitudes and perceptions. We measure individual exposure, over-time and unobtrusively, to partisan outlets as well as to news coverage of polarization through a fine-tuned BERT-based machine learning classifier. We find that both exposures increase perceived polarization, independently, in both countries. Yet, in both contexts, it is news coverage of polarization, regardless of whether it is ideologically left, right, or centrist news outlets, that is the strongest driver of perceived polarization. These changes are confined to personal-level polarization (perceived distance between oneself and members of the opposing party), while no measure significantly influences perceptions of society, more generally, as being polarized. These findings have important implications for our understanding of how the media’s increasing tendency to focus on conflict as a central reporting frame can be the driver of often exaggerated perceptions of partisan divisions.}",2025,Political Communication,"{computational social science,media coverage,partisan media,perceived polarization,web browsing data}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.06368881498970153
Using Google Trends Data to Study High-Frequency Search Terms: Evidence for a Reliability-Frequency Continuum,"{Google Trends (GT) data are increasingly used in the social sciences and adjacent fields. However, previous research on the quality of GT data has raised concerns regarding their reliability. In the present study, we investigated whether reliability differs between low- and high-frequency search terms. In other words, we explored the existence of a reliability-frequency continuum in GT data. Our study adds to previous research by investigating a more comprehensive set of search terms and different aspects of reliability (e.g., differences in relative search volume distributions, correctly identified maxima). For this purpose, we collected samples of GT data for ten high- and two low-frequency search terms. We obtained one real-time sample and 62 non–realtime samples per search term (30 non–realtime samples for low-frequency search terms). Data collection was restricted to search data for Germany. Our data support the existence of a reliability-frequency continuum—low-frequency search terms are subject to greater reliability issues compared to high-frequency search terms.

The Democracy i Like: Perceptions of Democracy and Opposition to Democratic Backsliding,"{When democracy is under attack, the hope is often that citizens will punish undemocratic incumbents. However, recent studies show that not all citizens punish governments for their undemocratic actions. In this article, we argue that citizens' understanding of and satisfaction with democracy are sources of heterogeneous reactions. In a survey experiment conducted in Germany and Poland, we show that the importance that citizens attach to specific institutions under threat, as well as their understanding of democracy, can explain much of the variance in citizens' responses to undemocratic actions. Citizens are willing to defend what they consider important for democracy - regardless of whether this reflects theoretical conceptions of democracy. Moreover, in times of democratic backsliding, Polish 'critical citizens', those who are dissatisfied with the way democracy works in Poland, are more likely to punish governments for undemocratic actions.

Between class conflict and culture war. How left-right self-positioning reflects elite conflict and social-economic context,"{The meaning of left-right ideology has been changing in European democracies. The left-right conflict has been traditionally understood in economic terms, pitting those who favour a more equal income distribution against those who believe that economic inequalities incentivize performance. Scholars have recently suggested that the terms “left” and “right” have taken a more cultural meaning relating to issues including immigration, the civic integration of migrants and national identity. Under what circumstances the left-right is understood by citizens in economic or cultural terms is less well known. In this article, we test top-down context (the framing of issues by politicians) and bottom-up context (economic and social circumstances) as correlates of this change. We conduct a cross-country regression analysis using eight waves of the European Social Survey for 26 European countries. We show that both the framing of issues by politicians social and economic circumstances predict citizens’ left-right self-placement.}",2025,Party Politics,"{economic issues,immigration,left-right,party competition,public opinion}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.0022011755395486016
"You can't see what you don't measure! A scoping review of measurements of gender-based violence, its determinants and consequences in academia","{Introduction Assessing the problem of gender-based violence in academia internationally is challenging due to a lack of empirical evidence and differences in how it is measured. The contribution of this article is to reflect on survey measurements and to propose new avenues for future quantitative measurements of gender-based violence, its determinants, and consequences in an academic context. For this purpose, we present the results of a scoping review of ten national and cross-national prevalence studies on gender-based violence. We examined the studies’ quantitative operationalisation of (1) sex and gender, (2) prevalence of gender-based violence, (3) socio-demographic determinants from an intersectional perspective, individual and contextual factors, (4) and consequences. Materials and methods Prevalence studies were identified through a comprehensive search of electronic databases and specialised data repositories. The selection criteria included studies with a focus on gender-based violence, the use of closed-ended survey questions, i.e., in a questionnaire, the potential for applicability in different national contexts, and the specific context of higher education. Eligible sources also described the quantitative operationalisation of the survey measurements. Results Our work critically reviews previous efforts to measure gender-based violence, its determinants, and consequences in academic contexts. The findings of our assessment show, first, that quantitative gender-related measurements tend to conflate the concepts of sex and gender, and hence their operationalisation in quantitative surveys. Second, there is a strong emphasis on sexual harassment and sexual violence to the detriment of other relevant forms of violence, as well as a rooting of measurement concepts in locally valid but diverse legal definitions of gender-based violence. Third, there is a lack of socio-demographic determinants to provide an intersectional lens, as well as a focus on measurement frameworks that individualise the experiences of gender-based violence. This prevents a conceptualisation of harassment and abuse as a structural problem in the academic sector and ignores that violence is both as a cause and a consequence of unbalanced gendered power relations and inequalities in institutional and societal contexts. Fourth, there is generally a retrospective approach to measuring the consequences of gender-based violence, which may represent a source of potential bias. We reflect on how future survey instruments could address these issues in academic environments. Discussion Overall, our paper demonstrates how the evidence generated by different conceptualisations and operationalisations of gender-based violence in academia, as well as its determinants and consequences, shapes how we think and talk about the problem. In doing so, this article contributes to the ongoing methodological discussion on the measurement of gender-based violence and provides a rationale for improving its measurement framework in academic environments by taking a feminist-theory informed approach to collecting these data.}",2025,PLoS ONE,,Multidisciplinary,SS,13,"gender, organizations, europe, inclusion, measurement",0.7873953945760925
From disruptive protests to disrupted news frames: Comparing German news on climate protests,"{This paper examines how news frames on disruptive climate protests differ from coverage of conventional protests in news outlets with different political leanings. Analyzing 6632 articles from 21 ideologically diverse German news sources between January 2022 and May 2023, we apply Word2Vec for semantic mapping, emotion classifiers, and qualitative evaluations to assess the frames present in the coverage of climate movements, and the anger attached to these frames. Comparing the more disruptive protests of the group “The Last Generation” and the more conventional protest movement “Fridays for Future”, we find that coverage of “Fridays for Future” varies predictably across the ideological spectrum: Right-wing outlets present protesters as extreme or criminal, while other outlets make reference to climate justice within their coverage of the protests, thereby following the movement’s own framing. When covering the more disruptive “Last Generation”, the entire news landscape engages in an emotionally-charged debate, asking whether the protesters are extremists or criminals, while barely discussing their actual demands. Amid an increasingly affectively polarized media debate on disruptive climate protests, left- and right-wing media remain divided in their evaluations of the protests, but focus on criminality and extremism rather than climate justice. The findings should serve as a reminder to journalists of their responsibility to carefully reflect the frames through which they cover protest movements.}",2025,Journalism,"{activism,climate protest,disruptive protest,framing,polarization,protest paradigm}",Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",0.7591380938395708
Creating Design Weights for a Panel Survey With Multiple Refreshment Samples: A General Discussion With an Application to a Probability-Based Mixed-Mode Panel,"{Panel surveys suffer from attrition, where participants drop out over time. To maintain generalizability, refreshment samples are frequently employed, bringing in new individuals, increasing the number of panelists, and balancing sample composition. Although refreshment samples offer numerous advantages, the inclusion of new panel members may introduce bias into the analysis if the design weights are not appropriately tailored to these new members and adjusted to align with existing panel members. If not correctly accounted for, their inclusion may bias results. This paper addresses the issue of designing proper weights by applying the multiple-frame weighting approach proposed by Kalton and Anderson, which is generally used for cross-sectional surveys, to ongoing panel studies with refreshment samples. We demonstrate its application to a synthetic data set and a probability-based mixed-mode panel with an initial sample and two refreshment samples. We compare estimates obtained using multiple-frame weighting with those obtained using unweighted and naively weighted methods (where design weights are used as calculated for the respective samples without adjusting for the fact that some members of the population have a chance of being sampled more than once due to the refreshments). These comparisons showcase the potential for bias introduced by neglecting proper weighting and underscore the importance of both a multiple-frame weighting approach and meticulous sample documentation.}",2025,"Methods, Data, Analyses","{gesis panel,inclusion probabilities,multiple-frame weighting,panel surveys,refreshment samples}",Mathematics,SS,6,"nonresponse, waves, machine learning, mixed mode panel, population",1.0
Research Knowledge Graphs: The Shifting Paradigm of Scholarly Information Representation,"{Sharing and reusing research artifacts, such as datasets, publications, or methods is a fundamental part of scientific activity, where heterogeneity of resources and metadata and the common practice of capturing information in unstructured publications pose crucial challenges. Reproducibility of research and finding state-of-the-art methods or data have become increasingly challenging. In this context, the concept of Research Knowledge Graphs (RKGs) has emerged, aiming at providing an easy to use and machine-actionable representation of research artifacts and their relations. That is facilitated through the use of established principles for data representation, the consistent adoption of globally unique persistent identifiers and the reuse and linking of vocabularies and data. This paper provides the first conceptualisation of the RKG vision, a categorisation of in-use RKGs together with a description of RKG building blocks and principles. We also survey real-world RKG implementations differing with respect to scale, schema, data, used vocabulary, and reliability of the contained data. We also characterise different RKG construction methodologies and provide a forward-looking perspective on the diverse applications, opportunities, and challenges associated with the RKG vision.}",2025,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"{information representation,knowledge graphs,linked data,open science,scholarly knowledge}",Mathematics,SS,2,"facebook, reliability, web browsing, tracking, life",1.0
A first look at low literates in PIAAC Germany 2023,"{Literacy skills are a prerequisite to fully participate in society and are related to better chances on the labour market. Results from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) show that a substantial proportion of adults in many participating countries possesses only low literacy skills. In Germany this proportion amounts to a fifth of the adult population, which warrants further investigation into factors that might be related to low skills. The aim of the paper is to investigate how selected background characteristics are related to low literacy and how literacy is related to certain life outcomes. Using the most recent German data from PIAAC 2023, we contrasted two groups: low literates and medium-to-high literates and compared them according to various determinants or outcomes of literacy skills. Significant differences between the two groups were found for age, gender, language background, educational attainment, employment status, occupation group, job satisfaction, and social background. Additionally, averages for life satisfaction, social trust, and political efficacy showed significant differences between low literates and medium-to-high literates. Furthermore, a linear probability model for the selected characteristics showed that, when controlling for other factors, each of these separate factors contributed to the probability of being low literate. The strongest effects were found for low education and having another native language than German.}",2025,International Journal of Lifelong Education,"{determinants and outcomes of skills,literacy,low literacy,piaac,skills}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Inflation of crisis coverage?

The number and salience of crisis news waves tied to discernible events has increased at a slower pace. The hypothesized driving forces - government expansion, mediatization of politics, and the activity of crisis frame sponsors - explain the development well and allow accurate predictions even when ignoring time in the forecasting model.

CASMIN Versus ISCED: Validating Standard Education Variables for German Microdata,"{In German surveys, educational attainment is typically assessed through two questionnaire items: the highest general school-leaving qualification and the highest vocational qualification or higher education degree. These items are often combined into one variable for analysis, but there is no standard method for doing so. This hinders comparisons across publications and the aggregation of research data. This article presents the results of a large-scale validation of candidates for a German standard education variable based on the official International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) and the sociological Comparative Analysis of Social Mobility in Industrial Nations education scheme (CASMIN), both commonly used in Germany. Many survey datasets offer a derived ISCED variable that reflects the main ISCED levels; fewer offer CASMIN. The validation uses ALLBUS 2018 data and a data-driven selection of 157 validation variables. Candidate standard education variables that retain a higher relative partial explanatory power across validation variables in linear multiple regression models compared to the most detailed education variable are considered more valid. The results show that CASMIN-based candidates generally outperform ISCED-based candidates of the same number of categories. An ISCED-based variable performs better only when measured in a highly detailed fashion that accounts for the stratification of the German educational system. The commonly used aggregation into three broad education levels loses about half the explanatory power of the detailed variable. Research data centers are called upon to provide a CASMIN variable to data users, and researchers to use CASMIN rather than ISCED whenever possible.}",2025,Kolner Zeitschrift fur Soziologie und Sozialpsychologie,"{coding,data quality,measurement,sociodemographics,standardization,survey data}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.9781179037572459
Rethinking political space in Europe: the modernisation and globalisation dimensions,"{This study challenges the conventional conceptualisation of political space in European countries as a two-dimensional socio-economic and socio-cultural structure.

Instead, it introduces a novel framework based on two overarching socio-economic processes–globalisation and modernisation. The study identifies two core social dimensions that also include economic considerations: the modernisation dimension, which links traditional gender roles and opposition to same-sex marriage with attitudes toward climate change, often accompanied by support for wealth redistribution; and the globalisation dimension, which, although less uniform, consistently centres around immigration.

"Ready or not. National identity, vote choice, and mass media: Evidence from Germany","{Exploiting the increased prominence of debates on immigration, right-wing parties often frame and campaign against immigrants as a threat to national societies. Research on national identity has shown that these parties are particularly successful among voters with an ethnically charged, exclusionary conception of nation. National identity, however, tends to be rather latent and stable, while far-right voting is much more volatile. Explaining a temporal influence of national identity on political behavior, social-psychological theories argue that identities need to be activated to become behaviorally relevant. The main argument of this article is that the presence of immigration-related news in the mass media can serve as such a situational factor for thinking about the nation and thus increase its salience for electoral behavior. Combining individual-level panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study's Short-term Campaign Panel (GLES, 2019) with a measure of media salience of immigration-related news in news articles, this study is the first to examine whether national identity can be activated for political behavior through the salience of immigration-related issues in the mass media using panel data.}",2025,Political Psychology,"{identity activation,media salience,national identity,voting}",Social Sciences,SS,22,"voting, immigration, media, right wing, individual level",1.0

Characteristics of ChatGPT users from Germany: Implications for the digital divide from web tracking data,"{A major challenge of our time is reducing disparities in access to and effective use of digital technologies, with recent discussions highlighting the role of AI in exacerbating the digital divide. We examine user characteristics that predict usage of the AI-powered conversational agent ChatGPT. We combine behavioral and survey data in a web tracked sample of N = 1376 German citizens to investigate differences in ChatGPT activity (usage, visits, and adoption) during the first 11 months from the launch of the service (November 30, 2022). Guided by a model of technology acceptance (UTAUT-2), we examine the role of sociodemographics commonly associated with the digital divide in ChatGPT activity and explore further socio-political attributes identified via stability selection in Lasso regressions. We confirm that lower age and higher education affect ChatGPT usage, but do not find that gender or income do. We find full-time employment and more children to be barriers to ChatGPT activity. Using a variety of social media was positively associated with ChatGPT activity. In terms of political variables, political knowledge and political self-efficacy as well as some political behaviors such as voting, debating political issues online and offline and political action online were all associated with ChatGPT activity, with online political debating and political self-efficacy negatively so. Finally, need for cognition and communication skills such as writing, attending meetings, or giving presentations, were also associated with ChatGPT engagement, though chairing/organizing meetings was negatively associated.

Investigating the effect of animal visualisations on meat choice: An experimental lab study with a fake food buffet,"{High rates of meat consumption have negative effects on health and the environment. Various studies have shown that visualising animals (e.g., through photos of animals placed next to meat products) can induce cognitive dissonance and reduce the intention to consume meat. However, almost all of these previous studies were conducted in online settings. Therefore, the present study investigates the effect of animal visualisations on meat choices in an experimental lab study at a fake food buffet. We used a between-subjects design with three conditions: realistic images (n = 107), schematic images (n = 107), and no images (n = 107). As the dependent variable, we compared the proportion of meat that participants selected from the fake food buffet. Contrary to our pre-registered hypotheses, we found no differences in meat selection, neither between the animal visualisation conditions compared to the control group, nor between the realistic and the schematic image condition. Moreover, we found no support for a mediating effect of cognitive dissonance.

Intergenerational family life courses and wealth accumulation in Norway,"{While prior research has widely acknowledged the consequences of specific family transitions (e.g., parental death, parenthood, grandparenthood) for individual wealth holdings, the interplay of multiple family transitions and positions occurring at different life stages and in various orderings has received little attention. This is despite the fact that these transitions and positions most likely jointly shape wealth accumulation, both in the shorter and longer run. We apply (1) sequence analysis to identify typical family life course clusters defined by the timing of the death of the parent generation, the timing of the transition into parenthood, and grandparenthood and (2) regression analysis to describe how the accumulation of wealth between ages 40 and 64 differs by family life course cluster. Using Norwegian register data of individuals born in 1953 (N = 47,945), we identified six clusters of family trajectories ranging from childless individuals to individuals who were sandwiched between their parents, children, and grandchildren because of relatively early (grand)parenthood and late parental death. Individuals experiencing patterns with a later transition into (grand)parenthood occupied stable and high wealth positions over time. Individuals without children exhibited a steady increase in their wealth position. Additionally, experiencing parental death later in life was associated with increasing wealth, whereas early parental death was not. These results held net of gender and education. Pronounced and even increasing wealth differences over the life course seem to be associated with the interplay of multiple family transitions.}",2025,Social Forces,"{administrative register data,intergenerational transmission,sequence analysis,wealth inequality}",Arts and Humanities,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Assessing Data Quality in the Age of Digital Social Research: A Systematic Review,"{While survey data has long been the focus of quantitative social science analyses, observational and content data, although long-established, are gaining renewed attention; especially when this type of data is obtained by and for observing digital content and behavior. Today, digital technologies allow social scientists to track “everyday behavior” and to extract opinions from public discussions on online platforms. These new types of digital traces of human behavior, together with computational methods for analyzing them, have opened new avenues for analyzing, understanding, and addressing social science research questions. However, even the most innovative and extensive amounts of data are hollow if they are not of high quality. But what does data quality mean for modern social science data? To investigate this rather abstract question the present study focuses on four objectives. First, we provide researchers with a decision tree to identify appropriate data quality frameworks for a given use case. Second, we determine which data types and quality dimensions are already addressed in the existing frameworks. Third, we identify gaps with respect to different data types and data quality dimensions within the existing frameworks which need to be filled. And fourth, we provide a detailed literature overview for the intrinsic and extrinsic perspectives on data quality. By conducting a systematic literature review based on text mining methods, we identified and reviewed 58 data quality frameworks. In our decision tree, the three categories, namely, data type, the perspective it takes, and its level of granularity, help researchers to find appropriate data quality frameworks. We, furthermore, discovered gaps in the available frameworks with respect to visual and especially linked data and point out in our review that even famous frameworks might miss important aspects. The article ends with a critical discussion of the current state of the literature and potential future research avenues.}",2025,Social Science Computer Review,"{data quality,data quality concepts,data quality frameworks,measurement,representation,systematic review}",Computer Science,SS,12,"digital, frameworks, social science, measurement invariance, error",1.0
Intergenerational family life courses and wealth accumulation in Norway,"{While prior research has widely acknowledged the consequences of specific family transitions (e.g., parental death, parenthood, grandparenthood) for individual wealth holdings, the interplay of multiple family transitions and positions occurring at different life stages and in various orderings has received little attention. This is despite the fact that these transitions and positions most likely jointly shape wealth accumulation, both in the shorter and longer run. We apply (1) sequence analysis to identify typical family life course clusters defined by the timing of the death of the parent generation, the timing of the transition into parenthood, and grandparenthood and (2) regression analysis to describe how the accumulation of wealth between ages 40 and 64 differs by family life course cluster. Using Norwegian register data of individuals born in 1953 (N = 47,945), we identified six clusters of family trajectories ranging from childless individuals to individuals who were sandwiched between their parents, children, and grandchildren because of relatively early (grand)parenthood and late parental death. Individuals experiencing patterns with a later transition into (grand)parenthood occupied stable and high wealth positions over time. Individuals without children exhibited a steady increase in their wealth position. Additionally, experiencing parental death later in life was associated with increasing wealth, whereas early parental death was not. These results held net of gender and education. Pronounced and even increasing wealth differences over the life course seem to be associated with the interplay of multiple family transitions.}",2025,Social Forces,"{administrative register data,intergenerational transmission,sequence analysis,wealth inequality}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Are there limits to empathy? A survey experiment on empathic concern and perspective-taking as bases for attitudes towards different groups of refugees,"{This article examines how empathic concern and perspective-taking influence different exclusionary attitudes towards refugees. More specifically, we investigate how empathic competence underpins social distance towards refugees and the opposition to granting them civil rights. Furthermore, we explore the potential constraints of this relationship by investigating the moderating role of different refugee characteristics via a survey-experimental approach using single-wave data from the GESIS Panel, a representative survey conducted in Germany. The refugee characteristics relate to having a Muslim versus Christian background and having high versus low qualifications, implying different levels of intergroup threat. The results indicate that higher levels of perspective-taking and empathic concern are associated with lower social distance towards refugees and opposition to granting rights to refugees. Furthermore, while the respondents’ exclusionary attitudes were higher towards certain refugee groups, implying higher levels of intergroup threat, empathic concern and perspective-taking predicted more positive attitudes towards the different groups of refugees equally. This implies that the effect of empathy does not depend on out-group characteristics.}",2025,European Societies,"{empathy,intergroup threat,out-group attitudes,refugees}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.14298726928076766
Annotating scientific uncertainty: A comprehensive model using linguistic patterns and comparison with existing approaches,"{We present UnScientify,1 a system designed to detect scientific uncertainty in scholarly full text. The system utilizes a weakly supervised technique to identify verbally expressed uncertainty in scientific texts and their authorial references. The core methodology of UnScientify is based on a multi-faceted pipeline that integrates span pattern matching, complex sentence analysis and author reference checking. This approach streamlines the labeling and annotation processes essential for identifying scientific uncertainty, covering a variety of uncertainty expression types to support diverse applications including information retrieval, text mining and scientific document processing. The evaluation results highlight the trade-offs between modern large language models (LLMs) and the UnScientify system. UnScientify, which employs more traditional techniques, achieved superior performance in the scientific uncertainty detection task, attaining an accuracy score of 0.808. This finding underscores the continued relevance and efficiency of UnScientify's simple rule-based and pattern matching strategy for this specific application. The results demonstrate that in scenarios where resource efficiency, interpretability, and domain-specific adaptability are critical, traditional methods can still offer significant advantages.}",2025,Journal of Informetrics,"{linguistic patterns,llm,research article,semantic annotation,uncertainty}",Social Sciences,SS,9,"government, metadata, channels, recognition, energy",1.0
Mapping modern kinship networks: First results from the KINMATRIX survey,"{Objective: This study presents initial results from the KINMATRIX survey, a large-scale source of ego-centric network data offering an unprecedented level of scope and detail in mapping family relationships. Background: Research on kinship networks is limited by the scarcity of available data. As a result, key phenomena remain insufficiently understood, including the importance of extended kin, contrasts between kinship lines, and cross-national differences. Notably, extended kin provide a unique “strength in numbers” that can enhance social transmission, integration, and support. Method: We analyzed data from anchor respondents aged 25–35 (N = 11,788 anchors; 239,220 anchor-kin dyads) collected in seven Western countries (Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States). Kinship networks included a large array of nuclear, extended, and complex kin (on average, 20 kin per anchor). We used descriptive methods to examine retrospective, current, and prospective assessments of kin ties across four measures: importance, closeness, contact, and support. Results: We report three main findings: First, extended kin are central to younger adults' lives, representing at least half of the family members they are emotionally close to, regularly contact, and deem important. Second, kinship networks are matrilineally tilted. Maternal kin are emotionally closer, more frequently contacted, considered more important, and more supportive. Third, cross-national comparisons reveal both similarities and notable differences, with the United States and Sweden showing elevated importance of extended and complex kin and Italy exhibiting higher social integration with nuclear and extended kin. Conclusion: Data on kinship networks can significantly advance our understanding of key family phenomena.}",2025,Journal of Marriage and Family,"{demography,family relations,family structure,family systems,intergenerational relationships}",Social Sciences,SS,27,"family, network, italy, united states, correlation",1.0
How affect shapes online information seeking about political actors,"{Search engines are both frequently used and widely trusted sources of current political information. While research has examined the different stages of information seeking via search, the question of how political preferences and sociodemographic factors impact political online search has received less attention. In particular, the way in which attitudinal factors, such as sentiment toward a politician or interest in their personal life motivate information seeking have not been widely studied. We present findings from a panel study that combines browser tracking data with survey results for 1863 German participants. Our results suggest that both sympathy and antipathy toward a selection of popular politicians is predictive of searching for them. Queries also vary in their composition, with searches for female politicians highlighting their personal lives and physical attributes somewhat more often than for males. We conclude that the role of “soft” factors in motivating information seeking on political actors remains underexplored.}",2025,New Media and Society,"{affect,gender,information seeking,online search engines,political communication}",Social Sciences,SS,18,"content, political attitudes, web tracking, measure, tweets",1.0
Radical right populism and the media: evidence from the supply side and demand side of political information in Germany,"{Hostile stances towards journalists and perceptions of media bias have become cornerstones of populist radical right identity formation. Despite a lively scholarly and public debate about the relation between populism and the media, a comprehensive account of the supply side of political information—radical right populist parties’ (RRPPs) communication—and the demand side—citizens’ information selection—is still missing. Focusing on the RRPP Alternative for Germany (AfD), this paper first establishes that its Twitter communication features more negative media-related cues and links to hyperpartisan news websites compared with the other major German parties. Self-reported media use from two high-quality surveys as well as a passive web tracking allow us to comprehensively characterize the information selection of AfD supporters. In line with the party’s media-related cues, people identifying with the AfD used alternative online sources more frequently amid less exposure to public broadcasting than supporters of other parties. Beyond Germany, media-related party cues and selective exposure by citizens might play an even more critical role in more polarized societies. More generally, the identified individual-level heterogeneity in media exposure is a scope condition that research on the aggregated societal effects of media coverage, e.g. on immigration, needs to consider.}",2025,European Sociological Review,,Social Sciences,SS,4,"polarization, security, misinformation, social media, election",1.0
Scoring German Alternate Uses Items Applying Large Language Models,"{The alternate uses task (AUT) is the most popular measure when it comes to the assessment of creative potential. Since their implementation, AUT responses have been rated by humans, which is a laborious task and requires considerable resources. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in automatically scoring AUT responses in English as well as in other languages, but it is not clear which method works best for German data. Therefore, we investigated the performance of different LLMs for the automated scoring of German AUT responses. We compiled German data across five research groups including ~50,000 responses for 15 different alternate uses objects from eight lab and online survey studies (including ~2300 participants) to examine generalizability across datasets and assessment conditions. Following a pre-registered analysis plan, we compared the performance of two fine-tuned, multilingual LLM-based approaches [Cross-Lingual Alternate Uses Scoring (CLAUS) and the Open Creativity Scoring with Artificial Intelligence (OCSAI)] with the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4) in scoring (a) the original German AUT responses and (b) the responses translated to English. We found that the LLM-based scorings were substantially correlated with human ratings, with higher relationships for OCSAI followed by GPT-4 and CLAUS. Response translation, however, had no consistent positive effect. We discuss the generalizability of the results across different items and studies and derive recommendations and future directions.}",2025,Journal of Intelligence,"{alternate uses task,assessment,automated scoring,creativity,divergent thinking,german,gpt,large language models}",Psychology,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",0.9020953465741272
The role of key European issues in the 2024 election campaign,"{International crises and Euroscepticism have made European issues prominent in citizens’ lives. This article studies the role of three key European issues–migration, the environment, and EU integration–for political parties and citizens. The analysis centres on nine EU member states, combining party manifestos from the 2024 European Parliament elections with survey data. It finds a gap between the concerns of citizens and the political parties, an important consideration for election campaigns in general. Moreover, the analysis suggests that the salience in party manifestos has a modest direct influence and a stronger indirect impact on their appeal to citizens in most countries studied. Specifically, citizens concerned with migration and the environment evaluate parties based on the prominence they give to these issues during the campaign. The findings offer important avenues for further research on party issue emphasis and the measurement of issue salience via large language models (LLMs).}",2025,West European Politics,"{environment,eu integration,european elections,large language models,migration}",Social Sciences,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.06747059546556183
A first look at low literates in PIAAC Germany 2023,"{Literacy skills are a prerequisite to fully participate in society and are related to better chances on the labour market. Results from the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) show that a substantial proportion of adults in many participating countries possesses only low literacy skills. In Germany this proportion amounts to a fifth of the adult population, which warrants further investigation into factors that might be related to low skills. The aim of the paper is to investigate how selected background characteristics are related to low literacy and how literacy is related to certain life outcomes. Using the most recent German data from PIAAC 2023, we contrasted two groups: low literates and medium-to-high literates and compared them according to various determinants or outcomes of literacy skills. Significant differences between the two groups were found for age, gender, language background, educational attainment, employment status, occupation group, job satisfaction, and social background. Additionally, averages for life satisfaction, social trust, and political efficacy showed significant differences between low literates and medium-to-high literates. Furthermore, a linear probability model for the selected characteristics showed that, when controlling for other factors, each of these separate factors contributed to the probability of being low literate. The strongest effects were found for low education and having another native language than German.}",2025,International Journal of Lifelong Education,"{determinants and outcomes of skills,literacy,low literacy,piaac,skills}",Social Sciences,SS,0,"germany, migration, differences, personality, election",1.0
Introducing the Archive of Interwar Europe Election Data & Assemblies (AIEEDA),"{We describe the Archive of Interwar Europe Election Data and Assemblies (AIEEDA), a new multi-level dataset of parliamentary elections in interwar Europe (1919-1939). The data contains electoral results for all parties that ran in 137 national parliamentary elections in 25 interwar European democracies. It further offers detailed time-invariant ideological and organizational variables for 401 parliamentary parties and 35 party alliances, along with time-variant data on their participation in 412 cabinets. Next to national-level election results, we provide disaggregated constituency/municipality-level results for Estonia, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, and Yugoslavia. Having collected national and disaggregated data independently, we validated each through the other. We also provide linking tables to parliamentary election results at the constituency/municipality-level for France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

Beyond age and generations: How considering period effects reshapes our understanding of personality change.,"{Age, cohort, and period effects are three ways to explain personality trait change over time. While past research mostly focused on age differences, showing relatively consistent patterns, evidence for cohort differences is more mixed, and period differences have hardly been examined. However, age, period, and cohort are exactly collinear (age = period—cohort), such that estimates are likely confounded and always hinge on so-called identification assumptions. Identification assumptions shape substantive conclusions, and inappropriate or inconsistent strategies may explain past discrepant findings. To address this age–period–cohort identification problem in personality change, we leveraged four large-scale (Ntotal > 2 Mio) repeated cross-sectional data sets from 2003 to 2022. Our aims were to demonstrate how identification assumptions common in personality studies impact estimates for age, cohort, and period and to use weaker, substantively informed assumptions to narrow down the range of plausible solutions. Results showed that common identification strategies of constraining one temporal effect to zero can dramatically affect conclusions—less for age-graded, but more for generational differences. Using weaker assumptions, our results indicated that all three factors—age, cohort, and period—likely contribute to trait differences over time. Assuming age-graded change in a certain direction revealed cohort-related decreases in extraversion, openness, and neuroticism and increases in agreeableness, alongside period-related increases in extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness. This suggests that several previously assumed cohort differences may actually be driven by period effects, overlooked due to strong identification assumptions. Overall, highlighting the importance of appropriate identification strategies, our results offer unique insights into factors driving trait differences over time.

Can I Trust and Share it? Enhancing Scientific Content in Social Media Posts with Additional Information,"{Recent advances on the web have made social media a significant platform for disseminating scientific information. However, posts referencing peer-reviewed research often lack sufficient context for non-experts to assess their credibility. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for enriching social media posts referencing scientific publications affect users’ trust perceptions and sharing behavior. We developed a web-based platform that simulates a social media feed containing posts with links to scientific publications and conducted a user study (N=160), comparing four conditions: a baseline with original posts, and three enriched variants containing (1) metadata from the publication (title, abstract, authors), (2) a direct quote from the publication, and (3) an AI-generated summary of the publication. Our results show that enriched posts were shared more frequently than baseline posts, though trustworthiness ratings did not significantly differ. Furthermore, the AI-generated summaries were perceived as the most understandable form of enrichment. Interaction data showed that users were more likely to engage with the enriched content than with posts containing only links to the publications.}",2025,ACM HT 2025 - Proceedings of the 36th Conference on Hypertext and Social Media,"{ai-generated summary,scientific information,sharing behavior,social media,trustworthiness}",Computer Science,SS,20,"open science, social media, publications, training, retrieval",1.0
Trade-off or co-evolution? Support for climate change policy in times of crisis,"{As governments intensify efforts to decarbonize their energy systems in response to climate change, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has (re-)introduced energy security as a salient and potentially competing policy priority. This study investigates whether the renewed emphasis on energy security expands the coalition supporting the energy transition or, conversely, creates a new axis of conflict that complicates public support. We argue that the energy crisis may simultaneously erode and reinforce public backing for climate mitigation policies, contingent on whether citizens view domestic renewable energy and energy security as complementary or conflicting goals. Using original survey data from Germany and Switzerland, we find that public opinion is divided on the perceived trade-off between energy security and the energy transition. Despite country-specific differences, individuals prioritizing energy security are consistently more likely to perceive a conflict between the two objectives. The findings highlight the need for policy strategies that frame climate and security goals as mutually reinforcing to sustain public support.}",2026,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"{climate change,energy security,energy transition,germany,multiple crises,switzerland,trade-off}",Energy,SS,-1,"energy, political, moderation, network, europe",0.03829645119103135
Debunking meat myths using the truth sandwich: A longitudinal experiment among German meat consumers,"{Correcting misinformation about the health and environmental consequences of meat consumption is crucial, yet research on effective debunking techniques remains limited.
