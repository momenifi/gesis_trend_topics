associations with key democratic attitudes and behaviors as news exposure. these findings offer a comprehensive analysis of the online political (not solely news) ecosystem and demonstrate the importance of assessing the prevalence and effects of political content in non-news sources."", 'media coverage of political actors and debates is a crucial avenue for voters to learn about political parties and their policies. however, nowadays party-media agenda-setting is increasingly shaped by large-scale transformations and the fragmentation of political communication across various party channels (e.g., press releases, social media, speeches) and media types (e.g., newspapers, television, online news), potentially affecting the provision of political information. this article examines these dynamics using large-scale textual data from political parties (n = 17,677) and media outlets (n = 90,531) published in the run-up to the austrian national election in 2019. building on the measurement of text similarity with state-of-the-art transformer-based models and multiverse analysis, we investigate the success of party messages from press releases, parliamentary speeches, facebook and twitter making it into important national newspapers, online news sites as well as television and radio news programs. the article shows that the variety in party channels and media outlets—with their distinct characteristics, modalities, and (technological) affordances—create different flows of information between the parties and the media. press releases remain crucial tools for parties to get their messages into the media, while social media and parliamentary speeches also matter, albeit with varying effects by party. we also find that online news is more receptive to party messages than print, television, or radio news. despite these differences, journalistic gate-keeping consistently favors large and government parties across all media types. these findings underscore the need for nuanced research into the interaction between party communication channels and media outlets in contemporary democracies.', 'media coverage of political actors and debates is a crucial avenue for voters to learn about political parties and their policies. however, nowadays party-media agenda-setting is increasingly shaped by large-scale transformations and the fragmentation of political communication across various party channels (e.g., press releases, social media, speeches) and media types (e.g., newspapers, television, online news), potentially affecting the provision of political information. this article examines these dynamics using large-scale textual data from political parties (n = 17,677) and media outlets (n = 90,531) published in the run-up to the austrian national election in 2019. building on the measurement of text similarity with state-of-the-art transformer-based models and multiverse analysis, we investigate the success of party messages from press releases, parliamentary speeches, facebook and twitter making it into important national newspapers, online news sites as well as television and radio news programs. the article shows that the variety in party channels and media outlets—with their distinct characteristics, modalities, and (technological) affordances—create different flows of information between the parties and the media. press releases remain crucial tools for parties to get their messages into the media, while social media and parliamentary speeches also matter, albeit with varying effects by party. we also find that online news is more receptive to party messages than print, television, or radio news. despite these differences, journalistic gate-keeping consistently favors large and government parties across all media types. these findings underscore the need for nuanced research into the interaction between party communication channels and media outlets in contemporary democracies.']"

particular, the effects of conditioning frequency, that is, different levels of experience within a panel, on response quality are underexplored. against this background, we investigated the effects of panel conditioning by using data from the gesis panel, a german mixed-mode probability-based panel study. using two refreshment samples, we compared three panel cohorts with differing levels of experience on several response quality indicators related to the mechanisms of reflection, satisficing, and social desirability. overall, we find evidence for both negative (i.e., disadvantageous for response quality) and positive (i.e., advantageous for response quality) panel conditioning. highly experienced respondents were more likely to satisfice by speeding through the questionnaire. they also had a higher probability of refusing to answer sensitive questions than less experienced panel members. however, more experienced respondents were also more likely to optimize the response process by needing less time compared to panelists with lower experience levels (when controlling for speeding). in contrast, we did not find significant differences with respect to the number of \\""don\'t know\\""responses, nondifferentiation, the selection of first response categories and mid-responses, and the number of nontriggered filter questions. of the observed differences, speeding showed the highest magnitude with an average increase of 6.0 percentage points for highly experienced panel members compared to low experienced panelists.']"
