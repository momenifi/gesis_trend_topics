People Make Better Edits: Measuring the Efficacy of LLM-Generated Counterfactually Augmented Data for Harmful Language Detection,"{NLP models are used in a variety of critical social computing tasks, such as detecting sexist, racist, or otherwise hateful content. Therefore, it is imperative that these models are robust to spurious features. Past work has attempted to tackle such spurious features using training data augmentation, including Counterfactually Augmented Data (CADs). CADs introduce minimal changes to existing training data points and flip their labels; training on them may reduce model dependency on spurious features. However, manually generating CADs can be time-consuming and expensive. Hence in this work, we assess if this task can be automated using generative NLP models. We automatically generate CADs using Polyjuice, ChatGPT, and Flan-T5, and evaluate their usefulness in improving model robustness compared to manually-generated CADs. By testing both model performance on multiple out-of-domain test sets and individual data point efficacy, our results show that while manual CADs are still the most effective, CADs generated by ChatGPT come a close second.

EvoRecipes: A Generative Approach for Evolving Context-Aware Recipes,"{Generative AI e.g. Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to generate new recipes. However, LLMs struggle with more complex aspects like recipe semantics and process comprehension. Furthermore, LLMs have limited ability to account for user preferences since they are based on statistical patterns. As a result, these recipes may be invalid. Evolutionary algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection are optimization algorithms that use stochastic operators to generate new solutions. These algorithms can generate large number of solutions from the set of possible solution space. Moreover, these algorithms have the capability to incorporate user preferences in fitness function to generate novel recipes that are more aligned with the fitness objective. In this paper, we propose the EvoRecipes framework to generate novel recipes. The EvoRecipes framework utilizes both Genetic Algorithm and generative AI in addition to RecipeOn ontology, and RecipeKG knowledge graph. Genetic Algorithm explore the large solution space of encoded recipe solutions and are capable of incorporating user preferences, while LLMs are used to generate recipe text from encoded recipe solutions. EvoRecipes uses a population of context-aware recipe solutions from the RecipeKG knowledge graph. RecipeKG encodes recipes in RDF format using classes and properties as defined in the RecipeOn ontology. Moreover, to evaluate the alignment of EvoRecipe generated recipes with multiple intended objectives, we propose a fitness function that incorporates novelty, simplicity, visual appeal, and feasibility. Additionally, to evaluate the quality of the EvoRecipe generated recipes while considering the subjective nature of recipes, we conducted a survey using multi-dimensional metrics (i.e. contextual, procedural, and novelty).

ExPAD: An Explainable Distributed Automatic Anomaly Detection Framework over Large KGs,"{RDF data is playing an important role in publishing and integrating heterogeneous data in data lakes. However, since the data is generally created utilizing liberal curation approaches such as crowd-sourcing and automatic extraction tools with no cross-validation on input data, the data is prone to errors that can be hidden in several dimensions. The types of errors which can be considered as outliers may occur in any part of RDF statements, especially in literal objects.

Why Net Worth Misrepresents Wealth Effects and What to Do About It,"{Wealth plays an important role in social stratification but the results that can be obtained when analyzing wealth as a predictor variable depend on modeling decisions. Although wealth consists of multiple components it is often operationalized as net worth. Moreover, wealth effects are likely non-linear, but the functional form is often unknown. To overcome these problems, we propose to 1) split up net worth into gross wealth and debt and evaluate their joint effect and 2) use non-parametric Generalized Additive Models. We show in a simulation study that this approach describes systematic wealth differences in more detail and overfits less to random variation in the data than standard approaches. We then apply the approach to re-analyze wealth gaps in educational attainment in the US. We find that the operationalization of wealth as net worth results in a misclassification of which children have the best and the worst educational prospects. Not negative net worth is associated with the worst educational prospects but only the combination of low gross wealth and low debt.

Shall androids dream of genocides? How generative AI can change the future of memorialization of mass atrocities,"{The memorialization of mass atrocities such as war crimes and genocides facilitates the remembrance of past suffering, honors those who resisted the perpetrators, and helps prevent the distortion of historical facts. Digital technologies have transformed memorialization practices by enabling less top-down and more creative approaches to remember mass atrocities. At the same time, they may also facilitate the spread of denialism and distortion, attempt to justify past crimes and attack the dignity of victims. The emergence of generative forms of artificial intelligence (AI), which produce textual and visual content, has the potential to revolutionize the field of memorialization even further. AI can identify patterns in training data to create new narratives for representing and interpreting mass atrocities—and do so in a fraction of the time it takes for humans. The use of generative AI in this context raises numerous questions: For example, can the paucity of training data on mass atrocities distort how AI interprets some atrocity-related inquiries? How important is the ability to differentiate between human- and AI-made content concerning mass atrocities? Can AI-made content be used to promote false information concerning atrocities?

Question Answering Versus Named Entity Recognition for Extracting Unknown Datasets,"{Dataset mention extraction is a difficult problem due to the unstructured nature of text, the sparsity of dataset mentions, and the various ways the same dataset can be mentioned. Extracting unknown dataset mentions which are not part of the training data of the model is even harder. We address this challenge in two ways. First, we consider a two-step approach where a binary classifier filters out positive contexts, i.e., detects sentences with a dataset mention. We consider multiple transformer-based models and strong baselines for this task. Subsequently, the dataset is extracted from the positive context. Second, we consider a one-step approach and directly aim to detect and extract a possible dataset mention. For the extraction of datasets, we consider transformer models in named entity recognition (NER) mode. We contrast NER with the transformers' capabilities for question answering (QA). We use the Coleridge Initiative 'Show US the Data' dataset consisting of 14.3k scientific papers with about 35k mentions of datasets. We found that using transformers in QA mode is a better choice than NER for extracting unknown datasets. The rationale is that detecting new datasets is an out-of-vocabulary task, i.e., the dataset name has not been seen once during training. Comparing the two-step versus the one-step approach, we found contrasting strengths. A two-step dataset extraction using an MLP for filtering and RoBERTa in QA mode extracts more dataset mentions than a one-step system, but at the cost of a lower F1-score of 62.7%. A one-step extraction with DeBERTa in QA achieves the highest F1-score of 92.88% at the cost of missing dataset mentions. We recommend the one-step approach for the case when accuracy is more important, and the two-step approach when there is a postprocessing mechanism for the extracted dataset mentions, e.g., a manual check.

SimE4KG: Distributed and Explainable Multi-Modal Semantic Similarity Estimation for Knowledge Graphs,"{In recent years, exciting sources of data have been modeled as knowledge graphs (KGs). This modeling represents both structural relationships and the entity-specific multi-modal data in KGs. In various data analytics pipelines and machine learning (ML), the task of semantic similarity estimation plays a significant role. Assigning similarity values to entity pairs is needed in recommendation systems, clustering, classification, entity matching/disambiguation and many others. Efficient and scalable frameworks are needed to handle the quadratic complexity of all-pair semantic similarity on Big Data KGs.

Dynamic global structure enhanced multi-channel graph neural network for session-based recommendation,"{Session-based recommendation is a challenging task, which aims at making recommendation for anonymous users based on in-session data, i.e. short-term interaction data.

Generating effective label description for label-aware sentiment classification,"{Sentiment classification aims to predict the sentiment label for a given text.

Exploring rich structure information for aspect-based sentiment classification,"{Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for aspect-based sentiment classification has attracted a lot of attention recently due to their promising performance in handling complex structure information. However, previous methods based on GCN focused mainly on examining the structure of syntactic dependency relationships, which were subject to the noise and sparsity problem. Furthermore, these methods tend to focus on one kind of structural information (namely syntactic dependency) while ignoring many other kinds of rich structures between words. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel GCN based model, named Structure-Enhanced Dual-Channel Graph Convolutional Network (SEDC-GCN). Specifically, we first exploit the rich structure information by constructing a text sequence graph and an enhanced dependency graph, then design a dual-channel graph encoder to model the structure information from the two graphs. After that, we propose two kinds of aspect-specific attention, i.e., aspect-specific semantic attention and aspect-specific structure attention, to learn sentence representation from two different perspectives, i.e., the semantic perspective based on the text encoder, and the structure perspective based on the dual-channel graph encoder. Finally, we merge the sentence representations from the above two perspectives and obtain the final sentence representation. We experimentally validate our proposed model SEDC-GCN by comparing with seven strong baseline methods. In terms of the metric accuracy, SEDC-GCN achieves performance gains of 74.42%, 77.74%, 83.30%, 81.73% and 90.75% on TWITTER, LAPTOP, REST14, REST15, and REST16, respectively, which are 0.35%, 4.22%, 1.62%, 0.70% and 2.01% better than the best performing baseline BiGCN.

Typically, these prompts are manually designed because the phrasing of these prompts impacts the knowledge retrieval performance, even if the LLM encodes the desired information. In this paper, we study the impact of prompt syntax on the knowledge retrieval capacity of LLMs. We use a template-based approach to paraphrase simple prompts into prompts with a more complex grammatical structure. We then analyse the LLM performance for these structurally different but semantically equivalent prompts. Our study reveals that simple prompts work better than complex forms of sentences. The performance across the syntactical variations for simple relations (1:1) remains best, with a marginal decrease across different typologies. These results reinforce that simple prompt structures are more effective for knowledge retrieval in LLMs and motivate future research into the impact of prompt syntax on various tasks.}",2023,"ACM Web Conference 2023 - Companion of the World Wide Web Conference, WWW 2023","{bert,knowledge retrieval,large language models,syntax aware prompt}",Software,Computer Science,Physical Sciences,CS,2023,"decoding prompt syntax: analysing its impact on knowledge retrieval in large language models {large language models (llms), with their advanced architectures and training on massive language datasets, contain unexplored knowledge. one method to infer this knowledge is through the use of cloze-style prompts. typically, these prompts are manually designed because the phrasing of these prompts impacts the knowledge retrieval performance, even if the llm encodes the desired information. in this paper, we study the impact of prompt syntax on the knowledge retrieval capacity of llms. we use a template-based approach to paraphrase simple prompts into prompts with a more complex grammatical structure. we then analyse the llm performance for these structurally different but semantically equivalent prompts. our study reveals that simple prompts work better than complex forms of sentences. the performance across the syntactical variations for simple relations (1:1) remains best, with a marginal decrease across different typologies. these results reinforce that simple prompt structures are more effective for knowledge retrieval in llms and motivate future research into the impact of prompt syntax on various tasks.} {bert,knowledge retrieval,large language models,syntax aware prompt} {bert,knowledge retrieval,large language models,syntax aware prompt}",4,1.0,"retrieval, impact, trained, context, large language llms"

SimE4KG: Distributed and Explainable Multi-Modal Semantic Similarity Estimation for Knowledge Graphs,"{In recent years, exciting sources of data have been modeled as knowledge graphs (KGs). This modeling represents both structural relationships and the entity-specific multi-modal data in KGs. In various data analytics pipelines and machine learning (ML), the task of semantic similarity estimation plays a significant role. Assigning similarity values to entity pairs is needed in recommendation systems, clustering, classification, entity matching/disambiguation and many others. Efficient and scalable frameworks are needed to handle the quadratic complexity of all-pair semantic similarity on Big Data KGs. Moreover, heterogeneous KGs demand multi-modal semantic similarity estimation to cover the versatile contents like categorical relations between classes or their attribute literals like strings, timestamps or numeric data.

To justify the computational costs of similarity estimation, the SimE4KG generates reproducible, reusable and explainable results.

Shall androids dream of genocides? How generative AI can change the future of memorialization of mass atrocities,"{The memorialization of mass atrocities such as war crimes and genocides facilitates the remembrance of past suffering, honors those who resisted the perpetrators, and helps prevent the distortion of historical facts. Digital technologies have transformed memorialization practices by enabling less top-down and more creative approaches to remember mass atrocities.

Question Answering Versus Named Entity Recognition for Extracting Unknown Datasets,"{Dataset mention extraction is a difficult problem due to the unstructured nature of text, the sparsity of dataset mentions, and the various ways the same dataset can be mentioned. Extracting unknown dataset mentions which are not part of the training data of the model is even harder. We address this challenge in two ways. First, we consider a two-step approach where a binary classifier filters out positive contexts, i.e., detects sentences with a dataset mention. We consider multiple transformer-based models and strong baselines for this task. Subsequently, the dataset is extracted from the positive context. Second, we consider a one-step approach and directly aim to detect and extract a possible dataset mention. For the extraction of datasets, we consider transformer models in named entity recognition (NER) mode. We contrast NER with the transformers' capabilities for question answering (QA). We use the Coleridge Initiative 'Show US the Data' dataset consisting of 14.3k scientific papers with about 35k mentions of datasets. We found that using transformers in QA mode is a better choice than NER for extracting unknown datasets. The rationale is that detecting new datasets is an out-of-vocabulary task, i.e., the dataset name has not been seen once during training. Comparing the two-step versus the one-step approach, we found contrasting strengths. A two-step dataset extraction using an MLP for filtering and RoBERTa in QA mode extracts more dataset mentions than a one-step system, but at the cost of a lower F1-score of 62.7%. A one-step extraction with DeBERTa in QA achieves the highest F1-score of 92.88% at the cost of missing dataset mentions.

Investigating the contribution of author- and publication-specific features to scholars’ h-index prediction,"{Evaluation of researchers’ output is vital for hiring committees and funding bodies, and it is usually measured via their scientific productivity, citations, or a combined metric such as the h-index. Assessing young researchers is more critical because it takes a while to get citations and increment of h-index. Hence, predicting the h-index can help to discover the researchers’ scientific impact. In addition, identifying the influential factors to predict the scientific impact is helpful for researchers and their organizations seeking solutions to improve it. This study investigates the effect of the author, paper/venue-specific features on the future h-index. For this purpose, we used a machine learning approach to predict the h-index and feature analysis techniques to advance the understanding of feature impact. Utilizing the bibliometric data in Scopus, we defined and extracted two main groups of features. The first relates to prior scientific impact, and we name it ‘prior impact-based features’ and includes the number of publications, received citations, and h-index. The second group is ‘non-prior impact-based features’ and contains the features related to author, co-authorship, paper, and venue characteristics. We explored their importance in predicting researchers’ h-index in three career phases. Also, we examined the temporal dimension of predicting performance for different feature categories to find out which features are more reliable for long- and short-term prediction. We referred to the gender of the authors to examine the role of this author’s characteristics in the prediction task.

Shall androids dream of genocides?

AI can identify patterns in training data to create new narratives for representing and interpreting mass atrocities—and do so in a fraction of the time it takes for humans.

Question Answering Versus Named Entity Recognition for Extracting Unknown Datasets,"{Dataset mention extraction is a difficult problem due to the unstructured nature of text, the sparsity of dataset mentions, and the various ways the same dataset can be mentioned. Extracting unknown dataset mentions which are not part of the training data of the model is even harder. We address this challenge in two ways. First, we consider a two-step approach where a binary classifier filters out positive contexts, i.e., detects sentences with a dataset mention. We consider multiple transformer-based models and strong baselines for this task. Subsequently, the dataset is extracted from the positive context. Second, we consider a one-step approach and directly aim to detect and extract a possible dataset mention. For the extraction of datasets, we consider transformer models in named entity recognition (NER) mode. We contrast NER with the transformers' capabilities for question answering (QA). We use the Coleridge Initiative 'Show US the Data' dataset consisting of 14.3k scientific papers with about 35k mentions of datasets. We found that using transformers in QA mode is a better choice than NER for extracting unknown datasets. The rationale is that detecting new datasets is an out-of-vocabulary task, i.e., the dataset name has not been seen once during training. Comparing the two-step versus the one-step approach, we found contrasting strengths.

However, authors or funders often must pay the publishing costs, preventing authors who do not receive financial support from participating in OA publishing and gaining citation advantage for OA articles.

A machine learning classification method helped us to explore the importance of different features in predicting the publishing model.

In contrast, authors eligible for an APC discount have the lowest ratio of OA publications, leading to the assumption that this discount insufficiently motivates authors to publish in gold OA journals.

Shall androids dream of genocides? How generative AI can change the future of memorialization of mass atrocities,"{The memorialization of mass atrocities such as war crimes and genocides facilitates the remembrance of past suffering, honors those who resisted the perpetrators, and helps prevent the distortion of historical facts. Digital technologies have transformed memorialization practices by enabling less top-down and more creative approaches to remember mass atrocities. At the same time, they may also facilitate the spread of denialism and distortion, attempt to justify past crimes and attack the dignity of victims. The emergence of generative forms of artificial intelligence (AI), which produce textual and visual content, has the potential to revolutionize the field of memorialization even further. AI can identify patterns in training data to create new narratives for representing and interpreting mass atrocities—and do so in a fraction of the time it takes for humans. The use of generative AI in this context raises numerous questions: For example, can the paucity of training data on mass atrocities distort how AI interprets some atrocity-related inquiries? How important is the ability to differentiate between human- and AI-made content concerning mass atrocities? Can AI-made content be used to promote false information concerning atrocities?

By testing both model performance on multiple out-of-domain test sets and individual data point efficacy, our results show that while manual CADs are still the most effective, CADs generated by ChatGPT come a close second.

CNIM-GCN: Consensus Neighbor Interaction-based Multi-channel Graph Convolutional Networks,"{Node classification plays a critical role in numerous network applications, and has attracted increasing attention in recent years.

Despite their effectiveness, these studies are still far from satisfactory due to the complex correlation information between the two spaces. To address this issue, we present a novel method named Consensus Neighbor Interaction-based Multi-channel Graph Convolutional Networks (CNIM-GCN).

A multi-channel graph convolutional networks is developed for effectively fusing information from different graphs. In addition, we further incorporate two types of consistency constraints, i.e., structural consistency constraint and reconstruction consistency constraint, to maintain the consistency between different channels. The former is leveraged to keep the consistency between different spaces at the structural relationship level, while the latter is used to preserve a consistency between the final node representation and the original node feature representation.

Specifically, we assume we are given pairwise comparisons of the items to be ranked produced by a set of evaluators. While the pairwise assessments of the evaluators should reflect to a certain extent the latent (unobservable) true quality scores of the items, they might be affected by each evaluator’s own bias against, or in favor, of some groups of items. By detecting and amending evaluators’ biases, we aim to produce a ranking of the items that is, as much as possible, in accordance with the ranking one would produce by having access to the latent quality scores. Our proposal is a novel method that extends the classic Bradley-Terry model by having a bias parameter for each evaluator which distorts the true quality score of each item, depending on the group the item belongs to. Thanks to the simplicity of the model, we are able to write explicitly its log-likelihood w.r.t. the parameters (i.e., items’ latent scores and evaluators’ bias) and optimize by means of the alternating approach. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm that our method is able to reconstruct the bias of each single evaluator extremely well and thus to outperform several non-trivial competitors in the task of producing a ranking which is as much as possible close to the unbiased ranking.}",2024,Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery,"{bradley-terry,evaluators’ bias,fairness,pairwise comparisons,rankings}",Computer Science Applications,Computer Science,Physical Sciences,CS,2024,"bias-aware ranking from pairwise comparisons {human feedback is often used, either directly or indirectly, as input to algorithmic decision making. however, humans are biased: if the algorithm that takes as input the human feedback does not control for potential biases, this might result in biased algorithmic decision making, which can have a tangible impact on people’s lives. in this paper, we study how to detect and correct for evaluators’ bias in the task of ranking people (or items) from pairwise comparisons. specifically, we assume we are given pairwise comparisons of the items to be ranked produced by a set of evaluators. while the pairwise assessments of the evaluators should reflect to a certain extent the latent (unobservable) true quality scores of the items, they might be affected by each evaluator’s own bias against, or in favor, of some groups of items. by detecting and amending evaluators’ biases, we aim to produce a ranking of the items that is, as much as possible, in accordance with the ranking one would produce by having access to the latent quality scores. our proposal is a novel method that extends the classic bradley-terry model by having a bias parameter for each evaluator which distorts the true quality score of each item, depending on the group the item belongs to. thanks to the simplicity of the model, we are able to write explicitly its log-likelihood w.r.t. the parameters (i.e., items’ latent scores and evaluators’ bias) and optimize by means of the alternating approach. our experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm that our method is able to reconstruct the bias of each single evaluator extremely well and thus to outperform several non-trivial competitors in the task of producing a ranking which is as much as possible close to the unbiased ranking.} {bradley-terry,evaluators’ bias,fairness,pairwise comparisons,rankings} {bradley-terry,evaluators’ bias,fairness,pairwise comparisons,rankings}",-1,0.03494654549061006,"retrieval, graph, tasks, artificial intelligence, llms"
A mutually enhanced multi-scale relation-aware graph convolutional network for argument pair extraction,"{Argument pair extraction (APE) is a fine-grained task of argument mining which aims to identify arguments offered by different participants in some discourse and detect interaction relationships between arguments from different participants.

First, different types of sentence relationships as well as different levels of information exchange among sentences are largely ignored. Second, they solely model interactions between argument pairs either in an explicit or implicit strategy, while neglecting the complementary effect of the two strategies.

Connected Components for Scaling Partial-order Blocking to Billion Entities,"{In entity resolution, blocking pre-partitions data for further processing by more expensive methods.

Previous work has sometimes related blocking keys by grouping or alphabetically sorting them, but-as was shown for author disambiguation-the respective equivalences or total orders are not necessarily well-suited to model the logical matching-relation between blocking keys. To address this, we present a novel blocking approach that exploits the subset partial order over entity representations to build a matching-based bipartite graph, using connected components as blocks. To prevent over-and underconnectedness, we allow specification of overly general and generalization of overly specific representations. To build the bipartite graph, we contribute a new parallellized algorithm with configurable time/space tradeoff for minimal element search in the subset partial order. As a job-based approach, it combines dynamic scalability and easier integration to make it more convenient than the previously described approaches.

Such corpora contain sediments of the personalities, values, beliefs, and biases of the countless human authors of these texts, which LLMs learn through a complex training process. The traits that LLMs acquire in such a way can potentially influence their behavior, that is, their outputs in downstream tasks and applications in which they are employed, which in turn may have real-world consequences for individuals and social groups. By eliciting LLMs’ responses to language-based psychometric inventories, we can bring their traits to light.

To facilitate effective and constructive scholarly communication about bias, we make two contributions in this paper: First, we unpack the conceptual confusion in defining bias, where bias is used to indicate both descriptive and normative discrepancies between LLMs and desired outcomes. Second, we suggest deontological reasons why bias is unacceptable. Common arguments against bias are based on teleological grounds which focus on the consequences of biased LLMs. We argue that bias should be identified and mitigated when and because it is morally wrongful discrimination, regardless of its outcome. To support this argument, we connect biased LLMs with Deborah Hellman’s meaning-based account of discrimination. Bias in LLMs can be demeaning and capable of lowering the social status of affected individuals, making it morally wrongful discrimination. Such bias should be mitigated to prevent morally wrongful discrimination via technological means.

A three-way decision approach for dynamically expandable networks,"{Conventional deep learning models are designed to work on a single task. They are required to be trained from scratch each time new tasks are added. This leads to overhead in training time.

The stability and plasticity of the model critically depends on three-way division of nodes into freeze, partially regularize and duplicate nodes. Freezing more nodes result in high stability but typically low plasticity. On the other hand, duplicating more nodes result in high plasticity but may not have an effective stability.

We trained and implemented a named entity recognition (NER) task using the flair NLP framework. The training was conducted using three default Flair NER models with four differently-sized corpora and different versions of the flair NLP framework.

Dissecting Paraphrases: The Impact of Prompt Syntax and Supplementary Information on Knowledge Retrieval from Pretrained Language Models,"{Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are known to contain various kinds of knowledge. One method to infer relational knowledge is through the use of cloze-style prompts, where a model is tasked to predict missing subjects or objects. Typically, designing these prompts is a tedious task because small differences in syntax or semantics can have a substantial impact on knowledge retrieval performance. Simultaneously, evaluating the impact of either prompt syntax or information is challenging due to their interdependence. We designed CONPARELAMA – a dedicated probe, consisting of 34 million distinct prompts that facilitate comparison across minimal paraphrases. These paraphrases follow a unified meta-template enabling the controlled variation of syntax and semantics across arbitrary relations. CONPARELAMA enables insights into the independent impact of either syntactical form or semantic information of paraphrases on the knowledge retrieval performance of PLMs. Extensive knowledge retrieval experiments using our probe reveal that prompts following clausal syntax have several desirable properties in comparison to appositive syntax: i) they are more useful when querying PLMs with a combination of supplementary information, ii) knowledge is more consistently recalled across different combinations of supplementary information, and iii) they decrease response uncertainty when retrieving known facts. In addition, range information can boost knowledge retrieval performance more than domain information, even though domain information is more reliably helpful across syntactic forms.}",2024,Long Papers,,Hardware and Architecture,Computer Science,Physical Sciences,CS,2024,"dissecting paraphrases: the impact of prompt syntax and supplementary information on knowledge retrieval from pretrained language models {pre-trained language models (plms) are known to contain various kinds of knowledge. one method to infer relational knowledge is through the use of cloze-style prompts, where a model is tasked to predict missing subjects or objects. typically, designing these prompts is a tedious task because small differences in syntax or semantics can have a substantial impact on knowledge retrieval performance. simultaneously, evaluating the impact of either prompt syntax or information is challenging due to their interdependence. we designed conparelama – a dedicated probe, consisting of 34 million distinct prompts that facilitate comparison across minimal paraphrases. these paraphrases follow a unified meta-template enabling the controlled variation of syntax and semantics across arbitrary relations. conparelama enables insights into the independent impact of either syntactical form or semantic information of paraphrases on the knowledge retrieval performance of plms. extensive knowledge retrieval experiments using our probe reveal that prompts following clausal syntax have several desirable properties in comparison to appositive syntax: i) they are more useful when querying plms with a combination of supplementary information, ii) knowledge is more consistently recalled across different combinations of supplementary information, and iii) they decrease response uncertainty when retrieving known facts. in addition, range information can boost knowledge retrieval performance more than domain information, even though domain information is more reliably helpful across syntactic forms.}",4,1.0,"retrieval, impact, trained, context, large language llms"

This paper aims to shed light on low-resource languages, particularly the Algerian dialect, through an experimental study with two objectives. The first one is to verify if the automatic translation from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) to the Algerian dialect can be considered an approach to increase the resources in the Algerian dialect, especially with the rise of large language models (LLMs). The second is to verify the impact of the translation-based data augmentation method on fake news detection by using transformer-based Arabic pre-trained models in different data augmentation configurations.

In contrast, individual statements can be collected to analyze debates in particular policy domains on a fine-grained level, in terms of individual actors and claims. In this article, we summarize a series of studies we have carried out. We apply NLP-driven (semi-)automatic analyses on these two channels and compare their potentials and challenges. The fine-grained analysis yields rich insights into the communication but comes at the cost of three challenges: (a) a substantial hunger for manual annotation, introducing practical hurdles for analysis both within and across languages; (b) difficulties in claim classification arising from the uneven frequency distribution over the theory-based annotation schemas; (c) the need to map actor mentions onto canonical versions.

Citation prediction by leveraging transformers and natural language processing heuristics,"{In scientific papers, it is common practice to cite other articles to substantiate claims, provide evidence for factual assertions, reference limitations, and research gaps, and fulfill various other purposes. When authors include a citation in a given sentence, there are two considerations they need to take into account: (i) where in the sentence to place the citation and (ii) which citation to choose to support the underlying claim. In this paper, we focus on the first task as it allows multiple potential approaches that rely on the researcher's individual style and the specific norms and conventions of the relevant scientific community. We propose two automatic methodologies that leverage transformers architecture for either solving a Mask-Filling problem or a Named Entity Recognition problem. On top of the results of the proposed methodologies, we apply ad-hoc Natural Language Processing heuristics to further improve their outcome.

On the Anatomy of Real-World R Code for Static Analysis,"{Context The R programming language has a huge and active community, especially in the area of statistical computing. Its interpreted nature allows for several interesting constructs, like the manipulation of functions at run-time, that hinder the static analysis of R programs. At the same time, there is a lack of existing research regarding how these features, or even the R language as a whole are used in practice. Objective In this paper, we conduct a large-scale, static analysis of more than 50 million lines of real- world R programs and packages to identify their characteristics and the features that are actually used. Moreover, we compare the similarities and differences between the scripts of R users and the implementations of package authors. We provide insights for static analysis tools like the lintr package as well as potential interpreter optimizations and uncover areas for future research. Method We analyze 4 230 R scripts submitted alongside publications and the sources of 19 450 CRAN packages for over 350 000 R files, collecting and summarizing quantitative information for features of interest. Results We find a high frequency of name-based indexing operations, assignments, and loops, but a low frequency for most of R's reflective functions. Furthermore, we find neither testing functions nor many calls to R's foreign function interface (FFI) in the publication submissions. Conclusion R scripts and package sources differ, for example, in their size, the way they include other packages, and their usage of R's reflective capabilities.

Connected Components for Scaling Partial-order Blocking to Billion Entities,"{In entity resolution, blocking pre-partitions data for further processing by more expensive methods. Two entity mentions are in the same block if they share identical or related blocking-keys. Previous work has sometimes related blocking keys by grouping or alphabetically sorting them, but-as was shown for author disambiguation-the respective equivalences or total orders are not necessarily well-suited to model the logical matching-relation between blocking keys. To address this, we present a novel blocking approach that exploits the subset partial order over entity representations to build a matching-based bipartite graph, using connected components as blocks. To prevent over-and underconnectedness, we allow specification of overly general and generalization of overly specific representations.

As a job-based approach, it combines dynamic scalability and easier integration to make it more convenient than the previously described approaches.

On the Anatomy of Real-World R Code for Static Analysis,"{Context The R programming language has a huge and active community, especially in the area of statistical computing. Its interpreted nature allows for several interesting constructs, like the manipulation of functions at run-time, that hinder the static analysis of R programs. At the same time, there is a lack of existing research regarding how these features, or even the R language as a whole are used in practice. Objective In this paper, we conduct a large-scale, static analysis of more than 50 million lines of real- world R programs and packages to identify their characteristics and the features that are actually used. Moreover, we compare the similarities and differences between the scripts of R users and the implementations of package authors. We provide insights for static analysis tools like the lintr package as well as potential interpreter optimizations and uncover areas for future research. Method We analyze 4 230 R scripts submitted alongside publications and the sources of 19 450 CRAN packages for over 350 000 R files, collecting and summarizing quantitative information for features of interest. Results We find a high frequency of name-based indexing operations, assignments, and loops, but a low frequency for most of R's reflective functions.

Patterns in the Growth and Thematic Evolution of Artificial Intelligence Research: A Study Using Bradford Distribution of Productivity and Path Analysis,"{Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology with applications across multiple domains. The corpus of work related to the field of AI has grown significantly in volume as well as in terms of the application of AI in wider domains. However, given the wide application of AI in diverse areas, the measurement and characterization of the span of AI research is often a challenging task. Bibliometrics is a well-established method in the scientific community to measure the patterns and impact of research. It however has also received significant criticism for its overemphasis on the macroscopic picture and the inability to provide a deep understanding of growth and thematic structure of knowledge-creation activities.

A mutually enhanced multi-scale relation-aware graph convolutional network for argument pair extraction,"{Argument pair extraction (APE) is a fine-grained task of argument mining which aims to identify arguments offered by different participants in some discourse and detect interaction relationships between arguments from different participants.

First, different types of sentence relationships as well as different levels of information exchange among sentences are largely ignored.

Bias-aware ranking from pairwise comparisons,"{Human feedback is often used, either directly or indirectly, as input to algorithmic decision making. However, humans are biased: if the algorithm that takes as input the human feedback does not control for potential biases, this might result in biased algorithmic decision making, which can have a tangible impact on people’s lives. In this paper, we study how to detect and correct for evaluators’ bias in the task of ranking people (or items) from pairwise comparisons. Specifically, we assume we are given pairwise comparisons of the items to be ranked produced by a set of evaluators. While the pairwise assessments of the evaluators should reflect to a certain extent the latent (unobservable) true quality scores of the items, they might be affected by each evaluator’s own bias against, or in favor, of some groups of items. By detecting and amending evaluators’ biases, we aim to produce a ranking of the items that is, as much as possible, in accordance with the ranking one would produce by having access to the latent quality scores. Our proposal is a novel method that extends the classic Bradley-Terry model by having a bias parameter for each evaluator which distorts the true quality score of each item, depending on the group the item belongs to.

Patterns in the Growth and Thematic Evolution of Artificial Intelligence Research: A Study Using Bradford Distribution of Productivity and Path Analysis,"{Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology with applications across multiple domains. The corpus of work related to the field of AI has grown significantly in volume as well as in terms of the application of AI in wider domains. However, given the wide application of AI in diverse areas, the measurement and characterization of the span of AI research is often a challenging task. Bibliometrics is a well-established method in the scientific community to measure the patterns and impact of research. It however has also received significant criticism for its overemphasis on the macroscopic picture and the inability to provide a deep understanding of growth and thematic structure of knowledge-creation activities.

Embedding models for supervised automatic extraction and classification of named entities in scientific acknowledgements,"{Acknowledgments in scientific papers may give an insight into aspects of the scientific community, such as reward systems, collaboration patterns, and hidden research trends. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the performance of different embedding models for the task of automatic extraction and classification of acknowledged entities from the acknowledgment text in scientific papers. We trained and implemented a named entity recognition (NER) task using the flair NLP framework. The training was conducted using three default Flair NER models with four differently-sized corpora and different versions of the flair NLP framework. The Flair Embeddings model trained on the medium corpus with the latest FLAIR version showed the best accuracy of 0.79. Expanding the size of a training corpus from very small to medium size massively increased the accuracy of all training algorithms, but further expansion of the training corpus did not bring further improvement. Moreover, the performance of the model slightly deteriorated. Our model is able to recognize six entity types: funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation, and miscellaneous. The model works more precisely for some entity types than for others; thus, individuals and grant numbers showed a very good F1-Score over 0.9.

Simultaneously, evaluating the impact of either prompt syntax or information is challenging due to their interdependence.

On the Anatomy of Real-World R Code for Static Analysis,"{Context The R programming language has a huge and active community, especially in the area of statistical computing.

Objective In this paper, we conduct a large-scale, static analysis of more than 50 million lines of real- world R programs and packages to identify their characteristics and the features that are actually used. Moreover, we compare the similarities and differences between the scripts of R users and the implementations of package authors.

A three-way decision approach for dynamically expandable networks,"{Conventional deep learning models are designed to work on a single task. They are required to be trained from scratch each time new tasks are added. This leads to overhead in training time. Continual deep learning models with dynamically expandable network architecture aim to handle this issue.

The stability and plasticity of the model critically depends on three-way division of nodes into freeze, partially regularize and duplicate nodes. Freezing more nodes result in high stability but typically low plasticity. On the other hand, duplicating more nodes result in high plasticity but may not have an effective stability. In this paper, we introduce an approach called three-way decisions based dynamically expandable networks or 3WDDEN and its memory-based version called 3WDDEN-replay.

Enhancing Software-Related Information Extraction via Single-Choice Question Answering with Large Language Models,"{This paper describes our participation in the Shared Task on Software Mentions Disambiguation (SOMD), with a focus on improving relation extraction in scholarly texts through generative Large Language Models (LLMs) using single-choice question-answering. The methodology prioritises the use of in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to extract software-related entities and their descriptive attributes, such as distributive information. Our approach uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and LLMs for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Attributive NER to identify relationships between extracted software entities, providing a structured solution for analysing software citations in academic literature.

A mutually enhanced multi-scale relation-aware graph convolutional network for argument pair extraction,"{Argument pair extraction (APE) is a fine-grained task of argument mining which aims to identify arguments offered by different participants in some discourse and detect interaction relationships between arguments from different participants.

"Investigating Characteristics, Biases and Evolution of Fact-Checked Claims on the Web","{Given the recent proliferation of fake news online, fact-checking has emerged as a critical defence against misinformation.

POS Tagging as a Catalyst for Effective Named Entity Recognition in Low-Resource Languages,"{Named entity recognition (NER) is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying and classifying entities such as names, locations, and organizations within text.

Understanding the Impact of Entity Linking on the Topology of Entity Co-occurrence Networks for Social Media Analysis,"{A common form of analysis of textual data is entity co-occurrence, where networks of entities and their connections within the text are constructed and their topology analysed.

Many established entity linking tools have been created for long text following standard spelling and grammar rules. As a result, the tools struggle on short, unstructured text such as tweets. On such text, it can be difficult to choose between tools and parameter settings, especially since ground truth is often unavailable. Given these challenges in entity linking on text and the direct influence of extracted entities on subsequent network analysis, we propose the need to apply multiple tools to create a more holistic set of results.

LLM Based Bilingual Rumor Verification Using Evidence From Authorities,"{The spread of misinformation as rumors is getting more prevalent on social media with its widespread use as access to instant information. Rumors on social media platforms can have damaging consequences unless timely intercepted. The existing studies on rumor verification use linguistic patterns, sentiment orientation, and network structures. It requires training data preparation and updating the model to stay up to date with newer rumors. However, little attention is paid to benefit from the known trusted, and credible authorities to verify rumors. In this study, we address rumor verification on platform X (previously Twitter) by using evidence from the timeline of authority accounts.

However, for under-resourced and linguistically complex languages like Algerian dialects (Alg-D), achieving high NER performance remains challenging, particularly in bridging the gap between MSA (modern standard Arabic) and Alg-D. This research investigates whether integrating part-of-speech (POS) tagging features can improve NER performance in AD, hypothesizing that the syntactic context provided by POS tags can enhance entity boundary detection and classification. To validate this hypothesis, we evaluate the performance of several Arabic and multilingual transformer-based models on two AD datasets (NERDz and DzNER) and one MSA dataset (CLEANANERCorp). Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating POS tagging achieves a significant improvement, with the best F1 scores of 78.76% on NERDz, 84.64% on DzNER, and 88.7% on CLEANANERCorp, highlighting the potential of POS tagging to address challenges in NER for low-resource languages like Alg-D.}",2025,Signals and Communication Technology,"{algerian dialect,deep learning models,low-resource languages,named entity recognition,nlp,pos tagging}",Control and Systems Engineering,Engineering,Physical Sciences,CS,2025,"pos tagging as a catalyst for effective named entity recognition in low-resource languages {named entity recognition (ner) is a critical task in natural language processing (nlp) that focuses on identifying and classifying entities such as names, locations, and organizations within text. however, for under-resourced and linguistically complex languages like algerian dialects (alg-d), achieving high ner performance remains challenging, particularly in bridging the gap between msa (modern standard arabic) and alg-d. this research investigates whether integrating part-of-speech (pos) tagging features can improve ner performance in ad, hypothesizing that the syntactic context provided by pos tags can enhance entity boundary detection and classification. to validate this hypothesis, we evaluate the performance of several arabic and multilingual transformer-based models on two ad datasets (nerdz and dzner) and one msa dataset (cleananercorp). experimental results demonstrate that incorporating pos tagging achieves a significant improvement, with the best f1 scores of 78.76% on nerdz, 84.64% on dzner, and 88.7% on cleananercorp, highlighting the potential of pos tagging to address challenges in ner for low-resource languages like alg-d.} {algerian dialect,deep learning models,low-resource languages,named entity recognition,nlp,pos tagging} {algerian dialect,deep learning models,low-resource languages,named entity recognition,nlp,pos tagging}",-1,0.08792603288048248,"retrieval, graph, tasks, artificial intelligence, llms"
Exploration of Hugging Face Models by Heterogeneous Information Network and Linking Across Scholarly Repositories,"{With the pervasive integration of Machine Learning (ML) focusing complex tasks across various domains, generally respective models and datasets are made available in numerous scientific repositories such as Hugging Face, GitHub for recognition and understanding within the research communities hence supporting open science initiative. However, the adaptability of these repositories is increasing among users hence raising a concern about the usability of these models and datasets effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to explore these repositories and compile comprehensive information that could facilitate users as well as repositories itself. Hugging Face, a leading repository, aims to furnish a platform that organizes and presents detailed information on models and datasets employed in research. As its adoption escalates within the research communities, the necessity to delve into such repositories becomes crucial to offer researchers valuable insights and promote efficient knowledge dissemination.

Data Discovery Using LLMs - A Study of Data User Behaviour,"{Data search for scientific research is more complex than a simple web search. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and their applicability for scientific tasks offers new opportunities for researchers who are looking for data, e.g., to freely express their data needs instead of fitting them into restrictions of data catalogues and portals. However, this also creates uncertainty about whether LLMs are suitable for this task.To answer this question, we conducted a user study with 32 researchers. We qualitatively and quantitatively analysed participants’ information interaction behaviour while searching for data using LLMs in two data search tasks, one in which we prompted the LLM to behave as a persona. We found that participants interact with LLMs in natural language, but LLMs remain a tool for them rather than an equal conversational partner.
